  <p>I haven't made any grand gameplay modifications; the Quake mod coding I've done has tended to be either for server administration or to just fix small things that annoyed me. There's a couple of those that I still have handy in usable form, so I've bucketed them in this part of the site. See the right-hand navigation bar.</p>
  <p>(Note that if you're looking for the mods that are a part of <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]birdseye.html">Birdseye</a> or <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]qsmack.html">QSmack</a>, those are described on the relevant pages in the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]index.html">Tools</a> section.)</p>
