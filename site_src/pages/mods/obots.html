<h1>Omicron Fixup</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>AI deathmatch &quot;bot&quot; mod for Quake (not QuakeWorld)</li>
    <li>fix minor annoyances in the original Omicron Bots mod</li>
    <li>released August 2020</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Another little tweak here for a grand old Quake bots mod. <a href="http://mrelusive.com/oldprojects/obots/obots.html">Omicron Bots</a> are still a good choice for Quake bots when it comes to DM maps that don't have any explicit waypoint support for other bots mods, as well as being a fun knockaround time in their rocket arena mode. <a href="[docs_mods_home_path]fbxpp.html">As was the case with FrikBot X+</a> however, the existing package had just a few rough edges that I've smoothed out. This is a really tiny set of changes but you might find them nice to have!</p>
