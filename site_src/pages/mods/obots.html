  <p>Another little tweak here for a grand old Quake bots mod. <a href="http://mrelusive.com/oldprojects/obots/obots.html">Omicron Bots</a> are still a good choice for Quake bots when it comes to DM maps that don't have any explicit waypoint support for other bots mods, as well as being a fun knockaround time in their rocket arena mode. <a href="[docs_mods_home_path]fbxpp.html">As was the case with FrikBot X+</a> however, the existing package had a few rough edges that I've smoothed out. This is a really tiny set of changes but you might find them nice to have!</p>
  <p>Specifically if you're experiencing lots of console messages telling you that some soundfile &quot;is missing data chunk&quot; and &quot;has zero samples&quot;, then you need this update. Also anyone playing the mod on Linux would benefit from some filename fixes in here.</p>
  <p>Note: I put together a <a href="[docs_guides_home_path]deathmatch_with_bots.html">&quot;Steam guide&quot;</a> about using bot mods (including Omicron) which I've mirrored on this site. It's kind of sprawling, but it does have a &quot;quickstart&quot; section and should clear up most of the common problems and questions. It also describes other bot mods that you may want to investigate, especially if you prefer QuakeWorld.</p>
