<h1>Ghosts Made Flesh</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>a variant on the &quot;Ghosts&quot; mod for Quake Tourism</li>
    <li>released April 2018</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is a tweak of JP LeBreton's <a href="https://jp.itch.io/quake-ghosts">Ghosts mod</a>.</p>
  <p>The Ghosts mod is a &quot;tourism&quot; mod that makes several changes to allow safely wandering through the levels of Quake. It also changes the soundtrack to use the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;Ghosts I-IV&quot;.</p>
  <p>This tweaked version of Ghosts restores the monsters into the levels, although they will not attack the player. You might like it if you feel that the presence of the Quake monsters is part of the ambience of the levels.</p>
