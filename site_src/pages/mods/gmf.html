<h1>Ghosts Made Flesh</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;tourism&quot; mod for Quake (not QuakeWorld)</li>
    <li>a patch for the &quot;Ghosts&quot; mod</li>
    <li>released April 2018</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is a patch/update for JP LeBreton's <a href="https://jp.itch.io/quake-ghosts">Ghosts mod</a>, a &quot;tourism&quot; mod that makes several changes to allow safely wandering through the levels of Quake. It also changes the soundtrack to use the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;Ghosts I-IV&quot;.</p>
  <p>The original version of Ghosts removes all monsters from the game. This tweaked version of Ghosts restores the monsters, although they will not attack the player. You might like this variant if you feel that the presence of the Quake monsters is part of the ambience of the levels.</p>
  <p>You will need to download and install the original Ghosts mod before applying this patch. More details in the readme.</p>
