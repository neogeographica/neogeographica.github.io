<h1>More Maps</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>Skirmish map selection UI fix for Quake 3</li>
    <li>support more maps per screen and more total maps</li>
    <li>released July 2000 (original), September 2013 (recompiled for current Q3 version)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's usually almost adorable how chunky the Quake 3 UI is, but if you try to use its &quot;Skirmish&quot; menu to play on a map against bots then it's just bad. That menu only displays 4 maps per screen and 64 total maps per gametype. Fortunately it was pretty straightforward to create a tiny UI mod that increases that to 12 maps per screen and 256 maps per gametype. (And honestly with RAM sizes these days, maps-per-gametype could have been much larger still... the old README file uses 128 MB of RAM as an example, which is cute.)</p>
  <p>If you're using the <a href="http://www.playmorepromode.org/">CPMA mod</a> then FYI that mod already has incorporated these changes, but otherwise a lightweight mod to improve this part of the UI may still be useful for you. I've recompiled the changes with the final Quake 3 game code to bring it up to date.</p>
