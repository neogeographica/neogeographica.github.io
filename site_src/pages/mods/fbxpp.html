<h1>FrikBot X++</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>AI deathmatch &quot;bot&quot; mod for Quake (not QuakeWorld)</li>
    <li>minor tweak to FrikBot X+, which was a tweak to FrikBot X</li>
    <li>released January 2013</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So here's the deal: <a href="http://www.inside3d.com/frikbot/fbx/">FrikBot X</a> by Ryan Smith is one of the best AI opponents released for Quake. FrikBot X+ is an updated version of FrikBot X as modified by &quot;Igor 9&quot;. The changes in FrikBot X+ were quite good, but they inadvertently removed the original FrikBot X capability of automatically cycling through multiple maps. So I added that feature back in. FrikBot X++ is just FrikBot X+ with map cycling.</p>

  <p>N.B.: Using FrikBot can be more than a little confusing. If you'd like to try, you may want to have a look at the <a href="[docs_guides_home_path]deathmatch_with_bots.html">&quot;Steam guide&quot;</a> that I've put together on that topic; it's kind of sprawling, but it does have a &quot;quickstart&quot; section and should clear up most of the common problems and questions. It also describes other bot mods that you may want to investigate, especially if you prefer QuakeWorld.</p>
