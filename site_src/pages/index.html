  <p>Welcome!</p>
  <p>neogeographica.com is currently a collection of possibly-interesting-or-useful things I've made related to Quake, Quake 3, and Quake Live. If those games don't float your boat then you won't find much of interest. Otherwise please use the tabs above to reach the main sections of the site!</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Last few changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dec 14 2013 :</strong> <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakesounds.html">quakesounds</a> utility for ripping sound effects out of Quake pak files and turning them into ringtone/alert sounds (or whatever other conversion you want)</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Nov 10 2013 :</strong> <a href="https://github.com/neogeographica/7-zip-pk3/releases/tag/v1.1">Minor bugfix release</a> for the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]7zippk3.html">7-Zip pk3 tools</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Nov 08 2013 :</strong> Speakeasy/MegaPath has mysteriously misplaced my fileserver, so I've moved all the downloads elsewhere temporarily while looking for a more permanent hosting solution. Please let me know (through the email address at the bottom of this page) if you run across a broken download link or a corrupted file.</li>
    <li><strong>Oct 27 2013 :</strong> <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]7zippk3.html">Quake Live pk3 support</a> in 7-Zip tools.</li>
