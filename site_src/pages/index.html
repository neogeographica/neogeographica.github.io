  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>neogeographica.com is a home for possibly-interesting-or-useful things I've made or collected that are related to Quake, Quake 3, and Quake Live. If those games don't float your boat then you won't find much of interest. Otherwise please use the tabs above to reach the main sections of the site!</p>

  <h2>&quot;Wanted&quot; posters</h2>
  <p>Some old Quake-related content seems to have managed to completely drop off of the internet. If you happen to be able to get your hands on any of the following things, let me know (contact info at bottom of page):</p>
  <table>
    <tr><td><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]misc/cpma.jpg"></td><td><strong>The Ruins of Oehm (oehm.pk3) :</strong> An early custom Q3 map that was popular on some ProMode servers. It vanished when all those Quake-era game-files websites died off.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]videos/common/t3finals_nav_thumb.png"></td><td><strong>ClanRing T3 Demos :</strong> Any demo from a game marked as &quot;no demo&quot; in <a href="[downloads_path]attic/t3demos/README.html">this readme file</a> would be a good find.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]misc/ramshackle.jpg"></td><td><strong>Ramshackle :</strong> A formative review site for Quake DM maps. I'm looking for a complete site archive &mdash; existing archives are missing lots of pages and/or pictures.</td></tr>

  <h2>Last few site changes</h2>
  <p>An overview of what's been going on around here. Note that for projects hosted on GitHub that have tagged releases, I won't necessarily update the list below for every minor release... you can follow the releases on GitHub if you're interested.</p>
  <table>
    <tr><td><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]common/map_nav_thumb.png"></td><td><strong>Nov 25 2024 :</strong> I rescued a few things from cohost.org before it closes, rehoming them into the <a href="[docs_attic_home_path]index.html">Attic</a> here: <a href="[docs_attic_home_path]kbd.html">reviving a mechanical keyboard project</a>, <a href="[docs_attic_home_path]apple.html">Apple II emulation on the Steam Deck</a>, and <a href="[docs_attic_home_path]myth.html">playing Myth on the Steam Deck</a>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]common/map_nav_thumb.png"></td><td><strong>Dec 22 2023 :</strong> A couple of quick notes. First, I've stopped updating <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html">Quakestarter</a>. Several reasons, w.r.t. my schedule as well as changes in the ecosystem of Quake sites and tools that make Quakestarter both more difficult to update as well as less useful/necessary, which is not a motivating combination! Second, I did update the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html">Linux Desktop Integration</a> to add a Firefox version of the browser extension.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]tools/common/linuxdesktop_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Jun 30 2023 :</strong> <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html">Linux Desktop Integration</a> bumped again. Some minor bugfixes, but the main thing is (as referenced below) moving the browser extension to the new "manifest v3" framework that Chrome wants everyone to use.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]tools/common/linuxdesktop_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Feb 16 2023 :</strong> A new version tagged for the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html">Linux Desktop Integration</a>. Mainly about storing the config file in an XDG-compliant way, but also some prep work for an upcoming change in the browser extension that will be required by Chrome. See the <a href="https://github.com/neogeographica/singleplayer_scripts/releases/tag/v1.4.0">release notes</a> for details.</td></tr>
