  <p>Welcome!</p>
  <p>neogeographica.com is currently a collection of possibly-interesting-or-useful things I've made related to Quake, Quake 3, and Quake Live. If those games don't float your boat then you won't find much of interest. Otherwise please use the tabs above to reach the main sections of the site!</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Last few changes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nov 08 2013 :</strong> Speakeasy/MegaPath has mysteriously misplaced my fileserver, so I've moved all the downloads elsewhere temporarily while looking for a more permanent hosting solution. Please let me know (through the email address at the bottom of this page) if you run across a broken download link or a corrupted file.</li>
    <li><strong>Oct 27 2013 :</strong> <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]7zippk3.html">Quake Live pk3 support</a> in 7-Zip tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Oct 02 2013 :</strong> Quake Live versions now available for the Q3CTF maps.</li>
  </ul>
