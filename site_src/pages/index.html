  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>neogeographica.com is a home for possibly-interesting-or-useful things I've made or collected that are related to Quake, Quake 3, and Quake Live. If those games don't float your boat then you won't find much of interest. Otherwise please use the tabs above to reach the main sections of the site!</p>

  <h2>&quot;Wanted&quot; posters</h2>
  <p>Some old Quake-related content seems to have managed to completely drop off of the internet. If you happen to be able to get your hands on any of the following things, let me know (contact info at bottom of page):</p>

    <tr><td><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]misc/cpma.jpg"></td><td><strong>The Ruins of Oehm (oehm.pk3) :</strong> An early custom Q3 map that was popular on some ProMode servers. It vanished when all those Quake-era game-files websites died off.</td></tr>

  <h2>Last few site changes</h2>
  <p>An overview of what's been going on around here. Note that for projects hosted on GitHub that have tagged releases, I won't necessarily update the list below for every minor release... you can follow the releases on GitHub if you're interested.</p>
  <table>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]tools/common/linuxdesktop_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Feb 16 2023 :</strong> A new version tagged for the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html">Linux Desktop Integration</a>. Mainly about storing the config file in an XDG-compliant way, but also some prep work for an upcoming change in the browser extension that will be required by Chrome. See the <a href="https://github.com/neogeographica/singleplayer_scripts/releases/tag/v1.4.0">release notes</a> for details.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]tools/common/quakestarter_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Aug 08 2022 :</strong> Another month, another version of the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html">Quake Singleplayer Starter Pack</a>. The big new addition is an autoupdater, which lets us do more timely Quakestarter updates in the future. More stuff in here too though! As usual the <a href="https://neogeographica.com/quakestarter_html/other_stuff/changelog.html">changelog</a> has the details.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]tools/common/linuxdesktop_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Jul 17 2022 :</strong> A couple of notable updates recently for both the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]linuxdesktop.html">Linux Desktop Integration</a> and also the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html">Quake Singleplayer Starter Pack</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/neogeographica/singleplayer_scripts/releases/tag/v1.3.0">release notes</a> for details on the Linux stuff. For Quakestarter, the main change is using vkQuake+Ironwail as the bundled engines.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]tools/common/quakestarter_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Apr 23 2022 :</strong> Well let's keep the updates coming for the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html">Quake Singleplayer Starter Pack</a>, which is now at version 3! The main things in this version are a much nicer HTML-ized presentation for the docs, and a feature for opening Quaddicted review pages. See the <a href="https://neogeographica.com/quakestarter_html/other_stuff/changelog.html">changelog</a> for complete details.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]tools/common/quakestarter_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Mar 23 2022 :</strong> First update in a while for the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html">Quake Singleplayer Starter Pack</a>! Several new installables added from the last year of releases. A few other changes to chew on too, like Ironwail support and better handling for when AD and Copper release new versions.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]common/map_nav_thumb.png"></td><td><strong>Mar 16 2021 :</strong> Various changes to &quot;download links&quot; presentation. Besides cosmetic changes, I've added informative links too, but I think the only truly new things (i.e. not previously available elsewhere) are the map sources for <a href="[docs_q3maps_home_path]jlctf1.html">jlctf1</a> and for my portion of <a href="[docs_q3maps_home_path]m3amap1.html">m3amap1</a>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_attic_home_path]interview.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]attic/common/interview_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Mar 10 2021 :</strong> First update to the Attic in a while... I've captured a copy of a <a href="[docs_attic_home_path]interview.html">1999 PlanetQuake interview</a> that has some good behind-the-scenes anecdotes about our old Quake server kitty1.stanford.edu.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="[docs_mods_home_path]obots.html"><img class="rawpic" src="[images_path]mods/common/obots_nav_thumb.png"></a></td><td><strong>Dec 05 2020 :</strong> I've been sitting on this little set of <a href="[docs_mods_home_path]obots.html">fixes to Omicron Bots</a> for a few months now, might as well put a page up!</td></tr>
