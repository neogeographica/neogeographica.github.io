  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>neogeographica.com is a home for possibly-interesting-or-useful things I've made or collected that are related to Quake, Quake 3, and Quake Live. If those games don't float your boat then you won't find much of interest. Otherwise please use the tabs above to reach the main sections of the site!</p>
