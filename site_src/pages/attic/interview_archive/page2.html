              <p><i>lemurboy</i>: 
                What can I say... ahnuld truly loves his work. :-) Although he 
                about had an aneurysm getting Blue to post anything about QSmack, 
                heh. QSmack really is a slick tool, the best NQ server admin tool 
                out there by a long long shot, and we got a lot of mileage out 
                of it; I guess that says something though about a large part of 
                the Quake player population. :-( We've gotten a little bit of 
                flack from banned players over the years, but I can't remember 
                a single case where they had a leg to stand on. (It helped that 
                QSmack logged all the chat and admin actions, so we could see 
                what *really* happened when someone got banned.) And I think that the lamer-elimination is another reason we 
                continued to have a good crowd of the type of player that you 
                *do* want on your server, long after most other Quake servers 
                started to empty out. On kitty1 you had to stay in line or hit 
                the road, and you could never tell when an admin might be monitoring 
                the server with QSmack.</p>
              <p>In-game lamers 
                aren't the only problems, of course. We've also had people try 
                to ping flood kitty1, run other denial-of-service attacks, or 
                use our servers to mount attacks on particular IP numbers or entire 
                ISPs. The &quot;Men In Black&quot; at Stanford Networking have been cool 
                in helping us out with these problems, as has our group's top-level 
                net admin. Cool in a sort of scary way, actually... after the 
                worst of these problems, our net admin passed along an email he 
                had received from Stanford Networking that basically said only 
                this: &quot;The offender has been located and dealt with.&quot; I prefer 
                to believe that just means that his ISP account got suspended 
                or something; hopefully nothing more drastic than that. :-)</p>
              <p><i>ahnuld</i>: 
                Yes, I'm glad they're on our side. It wasn't always clear that 
                they would be. Stanford is connected to the internet just like 
                anybody else. They pay a monthly bill just like you and me although 
                it's probably a little larger. :-) Stanford's payment scheme is 
                based on levels of traffic. There are arbitrary levels of traffic 
                that denote a certain cost and if Stanford goes over that amount, 
                their bill is significantly higher. Anyway, the people over at 
                networking noticed all this weird traffic to one machine and wondered 
                what it was. Our top-level admin explained to the brass what was 
                going on and they warned that if campus traffic ever came close 
                to the next higher level, they would have to shut us down because 
                we were such a large single source of traffic. Thank God it never 
                came to that. I really have to thank our top-level admin for looking 
                out for us.</p>
              <p><b><img src="[local_images_path()]bullet3.gif" border="0" height="11" width="13">PQ: 
                Any other interesting things to tell us about kitty1?</b></p>
              <p><i>ahnuld</i>: 
                Yes, actually. We didn't realize how popular kitty1 had become 
                until we had two independent visits from different parts of the 
                country by kitty1 disciples. I interacted with one and lemurboy 
                with the other...</p>
              <p><i>lemurboy</i>: 
                Hrmm. Well, there was this one player who we'd seen around our 
                server a few times who suddenly started sending me email; he had 
                managed to swing getting sent to a debate camp at Stanford and 
                now he was trying to arrange clandestine visits to our Quake Lab 
                so he could play on kitty1 with a micro-ping. It was a little 
                bit of a bother because generally the building would be locked 
                up on the weekends or after hours, and one of us would have to 
                let him in, but since he was going to all the trouble of skipping 
                seminars and evading the Debate Camp Curfew Police, we helped 
                him out. :-) He implied (if I'm remembering correctly) that kitty1 
                access was the motivating factor in him going to debate camp, 
                but he may have just been blowing smoke there.</p>
              <p><i>ahnuld</i>: 
                I think my story is even funnier. One day I was happily working 
                in my office when I was interrupted by someone else in the building 
                who was escorting these two young looking guys who were interested 
                in kitty1. Who were these people? I had no idea, but the person 
                who led them to me clearly wanted no part of this so they were 
                dumped on me. It turns that these two guys (I'll call them Tom 
                and Jerry to protect the guilty) were from Iowa on a college visiting 
                trip with Tom's mom and they wanted to see kitty1. How did they 
                find kitty1?</p>
              <p>Well, anyone 
                with a little UNIX savvy can look up some information on kitty1 
                and determine exactly what building it's located in and who is 
                supposed to administer it. Tom and Jerry had done this and located 
                our building on a campus map and then just started roaming the 
                halls asking everyone and anyone if they knew the person who was 
                listed as the administrator. Eventually someone did and that led 
                to me.</p>
              <p>I needed 
                a break from work and these guys clearly had made a big effort 
                to get here, so what the hell, let's go play Quake! I led them 
                downstairs and showed them the room where we kept kitty1. They 
                asked if they could play and I said sure. It was then that I realized 
                how serious Tom and Jerry were. Each quickly produced a 3 1/2 
                floppy with their configs. These guys from Iowa were prepared!</p>
              <p>We started 
                playing and Tom and Jerry couldn't contain their excitement. All 
                their buds were also on the server and Tom and Jerry just kept 
                typing talk messages that said, &quot;Look at my ping!&quot; over and over 
                again. I don't think they got one frag the entire 2 hours they 
                were playing.</p>
              <p>Now things 
                get interesting.</p>
              <p>After said 
                2 hours, there is a knock on the lab door and in walks Tom's mom. 
                Tom's mom is crying. She starts shouting at Tom and Jerry:</p>
              <p>&quot;Where the 
                hell have you two been? You said you'd be back in 5 minutes and 
                that was <b>2 hours</b> ago! I've been sitting in the car, in 
                the parking lot, with the engine running, for <b>2 hours</b>? 
                Is how you treat people? I bring you all the way across the country 
                to visit colleges and you are playing Quake!!!! I swear to God, 
                no more Quake for either of you!&quot;</p>
              <p>Tears are 
                streaming down her face and her voice is getting more and more 
                strained. Remember that it's just Tom, Jerry and me in this room 
                and I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable. Tom and Jerry were 
                nonplussed and continued playing and talking as if Tom's mom wasn't 
                there. Was everyone that big a dick when they were 18? Wow.</p>
              <p>At this point, 
                she storms out of the room and slams the door. After about 10 
                seconds of silence and no movement, I say, &quot;Hey fellas, don't 
                you think you should pack it up and head out with your mom?&quot; Tom 
                responds, &quot;Oh, don't worry about it, she gets like that all the 
                time.&quot; I'm thinkin', &quot;No shit stupid, because you're driving her 
                crazy.&quot; I finally convinced them to leave and hopefully prevent 
                Tom's mother from blowing a gasket.</p>
              <p>From what 
                I could tell from talking to Tom and Jerry, they were visiting 
                colleges in the Bay Area, but neither had any desire (or chance) 
                to attend Stanford. Their whole visit to campus was a ruse to 
                get to kitty1! I can just see the conversation in Iowa prior to 
                the visit. What parent is going to tell their kid that they *can't* 
                visit Stanford University?</p>
              <p><i>lemurboy</i>: 
                I'm surprised that ahnuld didn't mention another visit we had... 
                although I admit that other one is funnier. :-) The first time 
                I ever met an &quot;online acquaintance&quot; face-to-face -- probably the 
                first time for any of us, actually -- was when xris told B2, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Fong">Thresh</a>, 
                and Thresh's brother Cross to come test drive our Quake Lab. I 
                admit I thought it felt a little strange to be inviting these 
                people over after &quot;meeting&quot; them in Quake, so I just said hi, 
                did some small talk, and went back to work. ahnuld was eating 
                it up though; I think he was in there the whole time looking over 
                Thresh's shoulder and asking annoying questions. :-) This was 
                back when that gang were HPBs (Thresh used to ride his modem over 
                to kitty1 and thrash us sucky LPBs quite regularly), so most of 
                the talk I heard was about how tough it was to try to get used 
                to no lag...</p>
