                What's going on with kitty1 now?</b></p>
              <p><i>lemurboy</i>: 
                I handed the reins over to ahnuld a while ago in a vain attempt 
                to help me graduate, so it's up to him. I think just very recently 
                he's finally taken our Quake servers out into the pasture and 
                shot them. ::sniff:: I assume we'll continue to run Q3A public 
                FFA servers, and eventually a team server or two. Occasionally 
                I also have the urge to put up a QuakeWorld server, maybe to run 
                a custom DM maps rotation again. We've &quot;lost&quot; two of our four 
                CPUs to legit non-Quaking uses, so we won't be going as hog-wild 
                with servers as we did with Quake, but at the very least there 
                will be a few Q3A servers humming along.</p>
              <p>Anyway... 
                every now and then I see a Web page update or a message board 
                post or something, where an old school Quaker reminisces about 
                the good ol' days on kitty1, and that &quot;makes it all worthwhile&quot; 
                as they say. The PQ-hosted write-in poll where kitty1 ranked third 
                as &quot;best server of 1997&quot; (behind a popular Thunderwalker server 
                and inferno.idsoftware.com) was also cool, and unexpected. We've 
                been in a lull during the reign of Q2 -- and during most of us 
                actually getting some work done in our degree programs -- but 
                we'll be getting back some of our former game-hosting glory soon. 
                :-)</p>
