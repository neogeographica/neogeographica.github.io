<h1>PlanetQuake Interview</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>anecdotes from kitty1.stanford.edu server admin days</li>
    <li>originally published July 9, 1999</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My friend Jeff and I were interviewed by PlanetQuake once upon a time, as part of a series (I think?) of interviews/articles about folks who ran Quake servers. When I was reminded of this many years later, I went and had a look at what archive.org had saved from that interview... it kind of surprised me with the good &quot;war stories&quot; and little concrete details it has, stuff that I had begun to forget. Obviously this is still purely nostalgia-bait, but if you're in the same boat as me this may tickle some fun memories.</p>
  <p>So I've copied those three pages from archive.org and cleaned them up to re-archive them here. I haven't tried to reconstruct the whole PlanetQuake layout, which would be a) almost impossible (given what's missing/unarchived) and b) just a collection of broken links anyway. So these pages just have the main interview text in the theming and colors of PlanetQuake circa 1999. Dead links have been removed or updated.</p>
  <p>In the interview, you'll be hearing from us under our Cool Gamer Handles from back then, with me as &quot;lemurboy&quot; and Jeff as &quot;ahnuld&quot;.</p>
