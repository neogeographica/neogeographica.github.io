  <p>Back when HPBs still roamed the Earth, foraging in the jungles of ftp.cdrom.com and uttering their plaintive cry of &quot;laaaaag&quot;, I ruthlessly abused the advantage of a T3 network connection as one of the members of Clan 9 From Outer Space. I was also the main admin for our busy west-coast Quake servers at kitty1.stanford.edu (&quot;The Mothership&quot;) &mdash; later a Quake 3 server host as well.</p>
  <p>This section of the site was originally just a nostalgia dump for things from that time period that I found while shaking out old hard drives and poking through archives of old websites. If you were a regular player at kitty1 in the late 90s or early 2000s, or just someone who was deep into the online Quake community, you might get something out of that too.</p>
  <p>I've also begun to use this section as a lifeboat for some other potentially interesting info, items stranded by more recent implosions of websites/platforms. Just for fun &mdash; and again, nostalgia &mdash; I've tried to preserve the original theming of those pages. Pretty easy for an old Planet Quake page; pretty difficult for a modern website! We'll see if I can keep that up.</p>
