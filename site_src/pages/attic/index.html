  <p>Back when HPBs still roamed the Earth, foraging in the jungles of ftp.cdrom.com and uttering their plaintive cry of &quot;laaaaag&quot;, I ruthlessly abused the advantage of a T3 network connection as one of the members of Clan 9 From Outer Space. I was also the main admin for our busy west-coast Quake servers at kitty1.stanford.edu (&quot;The Mothership&quot;) &mdash; later a Quake 3 server host as well.</p>
  <p>This section of the site is more or less a nostalgia dump for things from that time period that I find while shaking out old hard drives. If you were a regular player at kitty1 in the late 90s or early 2000s, or just someone who was deep into the online Quake community, you might get something out of this too.</p>
