<h1>Keyboard Waffle</h1>

    <li>notes on resuscitating a mechanical keyboard project</li>
    <li>originally published January 9-14, 2023</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This was a series of effortposts to document the process of getting back into a long-interrupted mechanical keyboard project. I think it's mainly useful/entertaining for folks who are <em>not</em> already neck-deep in keyboard knowhow, but who would like to get a peek at some concrete details about what is involved.</p>
