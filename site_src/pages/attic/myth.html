<h1>Steamed Myth</h1>

  <p>The Myth games from Bungie were my other &quot;hobby games&quot; during the 90s, and I still revisit them occasionally. My most recent run was after getting a Steam Deck; for whatever reason, I decided to see if Myth could be properly installed/configured on the Deck and set up with a workable control scheme. The answer is yes! (IMO)</p>
  <p>Not to bury the lede too much, the main purpose of this post was really just to link to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mythdeck">MythDeck</a> documentation that I put together. But since I was rescuing some old cohost posts, I figured I'd grab this one too.</p>
