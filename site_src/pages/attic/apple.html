    <li>notes on Apple II emulation on the Steam Deck</li>
    <li>originally published January 13, 2023</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A little walkthrough-with-pictures for setting up an Apple II emulator (<a href="https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin/releases">AppleWin</a>) on the Steam Deck, specifically to play the <a href="https://archive.org/details/TotalReplay">Total Replay</a> collection.</p>
  <p>A couple of things I missed in my first go at this... First, you can play Total Replay in the browser, at its archive.org homepage! Not sure how the joystick support works in that case (maybe completely fine?) but regardless, very slick. And, there's a "sports-and-boardgames" sibling pack <a href="https://archive.org/details/TotalReplay2">Total Replay II</a>.</p>
