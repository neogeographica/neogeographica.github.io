<p>Excuse a brief preamble:</p>
<p>Back in the 90's when the original Quake buzz died down a bit (with 
Quake 2 coming out), I ended up rolling into Myth:TFL as my next 
internet game obsession.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Myth:TFL title graphic" title="Myth:TFL title graphic" src="[local_images_path()]Box+Front+upper.png">
<p>Mechanically &amp; aesthetically it couldn't be less like Quake, but 
in lots of ways it ticked the important boxes: always games ready to go 
online, side-by-side with "hangout" spaces; a constant fizz of news and 
drama and community creations; tournaments and player celebrities; a 
chatty development studio... plus some non-Quakey bonuses like 
story/lore to dissect.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="animation of Myth gameplay" title="animation of Myth gameplay" src="[local_images_path()]crowsbridge_small.gif">
<p>Since then, another similarity with Quake is that a hardcore 
community-developer contingent has kept Myth playable on modern 
machines. Not exactly Myth:TFL (although that still more or less works);
 the lion's share of the work has gone into its sequel Myth 2. That's 
fine though because a) Myth 2 is also cool and b) the entire Myth:TFL 
campaign and its multiplayer maps/modes are playable using the Myth 2 
engine these days.</p>
<p>So Myth 2 is something I've always had installed on one or more 
computers around the house. I don't go back to it as frequently as some 
of my old favorite FPS games but it's a classic.</p>
<p>When I got my hands on a Steam Deck recently -- and started getting 
into customizing it and loading various non-Steam games and tweaking the
 control mappings -- I kinda had to see how Myth 2 would play there. 
Like... would it technically run OK, that's sort of interesting, but 
more specifically the Myth games famously have a controls learning curve
 even with mouse+keyboard. Could one cram the Myth 2 control scheme into
 the Steam Deck's input map and actually have an enjoyable run through 
its singleplayer campaign?</p>

<p>...yep!</p>

(that's a link, click it!) is the result of going down that rabbit hole,
 probably too far. But hey another Quake analogy is that I've always 
been a wee bit too easily entertained figuring out my perfect control 
bindings.
<p>Both the control scheme and the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mythdeck" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">documentation</a>
 are wayyyy over-engineered for the level of use they are likely to get 
from anyone other than me. Sometimes that's part of the fun though, 
right? You gotta do something in the way that it wants to be done.</p>
