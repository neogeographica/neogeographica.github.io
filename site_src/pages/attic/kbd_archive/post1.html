<p>No? Just me?</p>
<p>Anyway, this past Xmas I gave myself the gift of picking up an old 
project and really putting my back into it, just git 'er done. The 
specific thingamabob in this case is a custom mechanical keyboard build.
 In speedrunning myself back to a headspace where I could finish things,
 it occurred to me that there are a bunch of interesting considerations 
here that would be fun to share.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>== DISCLAIMER ==</strong></p>
<p><em>This is not a comprehensive overview of the keyboard-building 
hobby, or a step-by-step guide to my particular build. This is just a 
series of effortposts capturing my recent project thoughts for the 
benefit of anyone who enjoys watching someone else nerd out in detail.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I'm not an expert, and in some spots I'm running on several-years-old memory here. Good-spirited corrections welcome.</em></p></div><div class="co-prose prose my-4 overflow-hidden break-words px-3"><hr>
<p>OK, so!</p>
<p>We've all probably seen folks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">posting pictures of their keyboards</a>
 right? Maybe with no particular context other than that they look cool 
(and/or barely usable) with their odd shapes, funny keycaps, and maybe a
 Christmas-tree lighting job.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(33.3333% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]ferris.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]ferris.jpg" alt="a stylishly angled picture of a tiny split-style keyboard with multicolored blank keycaps" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a><figcaption style="color: white; position: absolute; bottom: 6%; left: 2%; right: 2%; display: block; text-align: center; pointer-events: none; font-size: min(1.7vw, 64%);">Ferris keyboard</figcaption></figure><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(33.3333% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]maplestory-keycaps.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]maplestory-keycaps.jpg" alt="close-up photo of custom keycaps that are shaped like 3D renderings of Maplestory characters" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a><figcaption style="color: white; position: absolute; bottom: 6%; left: 2%; right: 2%; display: block; text-align: center; pointer-events: none; font-size: min(1.7vw, 64%);">Maplestory keycaps</figcaption></figure><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(33.3333% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]corsair-megarainbow.gif" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]corsair-megarainbow.gif" alt="animation of waves of colored light sweeping under the keycaps of a gaming keyboard" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a><figcaption style="color: white; position: absolute; bottom: 6%; left: 2%; right: 2%; display: block; text-align: center; pointer-events: none; font-size: min(1.7vw, 64%);">Corsair K95 Platinum</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>At some point I realized that many of these objects were being built 
from components rather than just bought from Razer et al., and that the 
build process was composed of some interesting technical and aesthetic 
tasks. In mid 2017 I decided to give it a whirl.</p>
<p>The aforementioned tasks, as I encountered them:</p>
<h3>Choose the base kit</h3>
<p>This typically includes the outer case and the circuit board. This 
choice affects the shape and appearance of the keyboard -- including 
significant variations like split "ergonomic" boards or ones that host a
 smaller set of keys. It will also determine what kind of LED lighting 
(if any) and connectors the board sports, and how 
configurable/programmable it is.</p>
<p>When I first got into this I liked browsing what was on offer at Massdrop, which is now just called <a href="https://drop.com/mechanical-keyboards/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">"Drop"</a>. For my first rodeo I chose the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Infinity Ergodox</a>:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]01+infinity+ergodox.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]01+infinity+ergodox.jpg" alt="a picture of the Infinity Ergodox split keyboard, with blank keycaps" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>Selling points:</p>
<ul>
<li>allegedly ergonomic, and that's beginning to matter to me</li>
<li>discourages hunt-and-peck typing habits, so that was nicely aspirational</li>
<li>super configurable (more about that later)</li>
<li>LCD display, helpful for feedback if your keyboard configuration includes different modes of operation</li>
</ul>
<p>The kit was delivered four months after the group-buy process concluded, which is not unusually slow for this kind of thing.</p>
<h3>Choose the key switches</h3>
<p>This determines how each key will react when you push down on it. 
Does the key go down easy or does it provide resistance? Is it smooth 
resistance or is there a tactile "bump" at some point? Does it make a 
clicky sound? This is one of many deep rabbit holes in this process -- 
if you're not careful you can find yourself squinting at graphs with a 
developing conviction that a particular switch isn't quite right because
 you would prefer a pre-activation curve that tops out with 10 fewer 
grams-force.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]02+box+white+force.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]02+box+white+force.jpg" alt="a science-y looking graph of &quot;Press&quot; and &quot;Release&quot; force-vs-distance curves for the Kaihua Box White keyboard switch" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>It is realllly difficult to choose switches you like based on reviews
 and testimonials. Ideally you would have a bunch of complete keyboards 
at hand to fiddle with, all using different types of switches, but most 
of us don't have that option. I think this is kinda of one of those 
things you just develop a feel/preference for with time and experience. I
 did get this little tester with varieties of Cherry MX switches:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]03+tester.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]03+tester.jpg" alt="a &quot;switch tester&quot; made of six keys in a row mounted on a plastic bar, each using a different color (kind) of Cherry MX switch" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>... which was better than nothing, but still not like actual full-hand typing. In the end I decided on <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_White" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Cherry MX White</a>, a middle-of-the-road popular switch type that wouldn't annoy co-workers with its clicking.</p>
<h3>Choose the keycaps</h3>
<p>One of the main aesthetic choices in the build is picking what the 
keys will actually look like. As with any product that has even a hint 
of "express yourself", you can find a bunch of different designs and 
colors on offer, from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/YMDK-Profile-Keyset-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07WV4NSQZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">utilitarian</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220702162705/https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=6306" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">breezy</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221216103909/https://www.etsy.com/listing/1154859933/mac-xda-keycap-set-mechanical-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">retro</a> to <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1323071156" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">gimmick</a> to <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-gmk-laser-custom-keycap-set" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">techno</a> to what-the-heck-ever.</p>
<p>I expected that, but I didn't know that I would also need to pay 
attention to material, switch-type compatibility, and profile. Let's 
skip those first two, but "profile" is interesting IMO. The profile is 
the height and shape of the keycap, including the shape of the top 
surface that your finger presses. This shape can vary depending on which
 row of the keyboard the keycap is intended for; especially for 
curved/slanted profiles it matters if your fingertip is going to be 
extending up or curling back to reach the key. There are <a href="https://www.keycaps.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">a bunch of more-or-less standard profiles</a> out there, although less than a half-dozen actually common ones.</p>
<p>In a sort of contrarian twist I wanted to use the SA profile:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]04+sa+profile.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]04+sa+profile.jpg" alt="side view of SA-profile keycap cross sections showing the difference from row to row" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>This is a big "retro" key shape reminiscent of IBM Selectric and 
Apple II keys. Not necessarily the easiest to use, but I liked the idea 
of mixing that look into the weird Ergodox form. Plus, the aggressive 
keytop sculpting would be another encouragement to do correct and 
efficient touch-typing. For the visual style of the keycaps I went with <a href="https://drop.com/buy/carbon?defaultSelectionIds=967954" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Carbon</a>:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]05+carbon.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]05+carbon.jpg" alt="view from above of a standard computer keyboard using the orange-grey-and-beige Carbon keycaps" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>Now, when buying keycaps you can't just order exactly the ones you want/need. If you click into that "<a href="https://drop.com/buy/carbon?defaultSelectionIds=967954" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Carbon</a>"
 link and scroll down, you can see the various sets that were available 
for order. You could have ordered a set of alphanumerics, a set of 
modifier keys, etc. A well-managed keycaps offering will try to have 
sets that can be mixed and matched to support many different keyboard 
forms, which is especially important with a profile like SA where e.g. a
 Ctrl key in row 4 will be shaped differently than a Ctrl key in row 3. 
Different keyboards may also have different width keys in different 
locations. In the end you'll end up buying lots more keycaps than you 
actually want if your keyboard is odd (like an Ergodox), just to get 
coverage of the ones you need.</p>
<p>(A further twist is that you may not actually <em>know</em> if your 
Ctrl key is eventually going to settle into row 4 or row 3 or wherever. 
But I'll talk about programming/configurability in a bit.)</p>
<p>Part of the fun, or "fun", of a keycaps group buy is that it's not 
clear which sets will finally be available until some number of folks 
have committed to buy them. If your fingers are crossed for some 
Ergodox-specific set then you really need a bunch of other Ergodox-ers 
to get on board.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ordered my SA Carbon sets and then waited a year for them 
to arrive. Which is not unusually slow for this kind of thing.</p>
<p>For use in the meantime I also ordered a set of <a href="https://drop.com/buy/granite-keycap-set" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">DSA Granite</a> keycaps that would arrive at the same time as the Infinity Ergodox kit.</p>
<h3>Assembling</h3>
<p>Once you have all the physical bits, the next step is to put them 
together! There's some amount of case-and-circuit-board assembly to do, 
along with getting the switches into the board and finally pressing the 
keycaps onto the switches. Traditionally installing the switches has 
involved a lot of soldering (two leads per switch, or more if you're 
installing per-key LEDs). "Hotswap" boards have also become a common 
option, where each switch lead just presses into a tiny springloaded 
clamp that ensures contact without soldering, but in this case it was 
time for a solder-o-rama.</p>
<p>I actually hadn't done any soldering since my undergraduate days in 
an electrical engineering program. But I read up, worked through some 
soldering practice kits, and set up shop on a little balcony for max 
ventilation. Whack on a podcast and it goes pretty quickly!</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(50% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]06+old+board+build.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]06+old+board+build.jpg" alt="table holding the Infinity Ergodox circuit boards, a soldering station, and related equipment" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a><figcaption style="color: white; position: absolute; bottom: 6%; left: 2%; right: 2%; display: block; text-align: center; pointer-events: none; font-size: min(2.2vw, 80%);">Work station</figcaption></figure><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(50% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]06b+solder.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]06b+solder.jpg" alt="close-up of the solder joints for the switches, such as they are" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a><figcaption style="color: white; position: absolute; bottom: 6%; left: 2%; right: 2%; display: block; text-align: center; pointer-events: none; font-size: min(2.2vw, 80%);">Noob solder joints</figcaption></figure></div>
<h3>Configuring</h3>
<p>Now when you push down on one of your fancy keycaps and it depresses 
your carefully chosen switch so that the relevant circuit is closed on 
the board, what happens? In modern keyboards this is just an input to a 
microcontroller on the board which looks back at you and says "Well... 
what do you <em>want</em> to happen?" It can and in most cases should be
 something as simple as "generate the code for the character A" but you 
can get almost arbitrarily arcane: choosing special things to happen if 
combos or sequences of keys are pressed, and/or having some inputs put 
your keyboard into a different mode that changes the keypress behaviors 
across the board. Your motivation for such shenanigans might be 
ergonomic, or maybe you have common operations like volume-mute or "lock
 my screen" that you want to map to a single keypress, or maybe you just
 enjoy being a keyboard wizard.</p>
<p>My Infinity Ergodox used <a href="https://kiibohd.github.io/wiki/#/Quickstart" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Kiibohd</a>
 firmware. If you're curious you can poke around in the wiki there to 
see what was possible with that system, but for reasons that will be 
clear later I'm not going to get into the configuration much at this 
point.</p>
<p>A few firmware-flashing test cycles later, my keyboard was good to 
go! And then after another eight months, I finally received the keycaps I
 had selected for it!</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]07+old+board.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]07+old+board.jpg" alt="my Infinity Ergodox build, outfitted with SA Carbon keycaps" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>Seems kind of ... finished, doesn't it? As projects go? Well yes. 
Actually this is NOT (yet) the project I referred to in the opening 
paragraph, depending on where you draw the boundaries of things I guess,
 but regardless it is very relevant and is great for background. :-)</p>
<p>The <a href="post2.html">follow-on post</a> to this one is now up. Wherein the plot thickens in its own mundanely nerdy way.</p>
