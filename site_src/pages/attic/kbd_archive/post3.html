<p>Aight let me wrap this up. A brief look at how these guys operate:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]18+new+board+1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]18+new+board+1.jpg" alt="Hot Dox split keyboard with orange/grey/beige keycaps" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a><figcaption style="color: white; position: absolute; bottom: 6%; left: 2%; right: 2%; display: block; text-align: center; pointer-events: none; font-size: min(4vw, 150%);">rescued SA Carbon keys + Kailh BOX switches</figcaption></figure></div>

<h3>LED check</h3>
<p>First of all, how about those LEDs? As mentioned previously, the pads
 I could use for indicator LEDs were obscured by the switch plate. 
However you can still see the light if you know what to look for (which I
 do!):</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(33.3333% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]red+led.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]red+led.jpg" alt="red LED lit, demonstrating visibility" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a></figure><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(33.3333% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]green+led.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]green+led.jpg" alt="green LED lit, demonstrating visibility" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a></figure><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(33.3333% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]blue+led.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]blue+led.jpg" alt="blue LED lit, demonstrating visibility" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>And if I'm working in a dark room it's very obvious, with the light filtering out from various spots, e.g.:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]red+led+in+the+dark.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]red+led+in+the+dark.jpg" alt="red LED lit in a dark room, highly visible" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>All right. I can use those for mode indicators. Blue is the weakest 
so it gets to be the indicator for the mode that is least likely to be 
long-lived (which turned out to be "macro recording").</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, it's finally time to talk about configuration. The
 most generally interesting question to explore here is ... why? Lots of
 folks probably don't have a burning desire to change the way their 
keyboard behaves.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(50% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]angry+typer.gif" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]angry+typer.gif" alt="animation of someone unreasonably angry at their own typing" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>My goals were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have alphanumerics in the normal QWERTY keyboard spots.</p>
<p>Move shift and enter to thumbs instead of pinkies.</p>
<p>Shuffle modifier keys as necessary to make common combos comfortable. This
needs to cover Windows, Linux, and macOS key combos that I use.</p>
<p>Support typing numbers and symbols using the main three rows (with
modifiers), for reduced finger reach. This includes a standard numpad
layout under the right hand.</p>
<p>Support typing arrow, enter, and space characters with the left hand (using
modifiers) for when the right hand is on the mouse.</p>
<p>Include common 'media' keys, volume control, brightness, and screenlock.</p>
<p>Support recording and playback of short key sequences.</p>
<p>Support basic mouse cursor movement and button clicks.</p>
<p>Make it hard to hit 'dangerous' keys/combos by accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're actually interested to see a) the key layout and config 
that comes from those goals, and b) the specifics of how you would 
program the keyboard to do that, I'll just link to the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neogeographica/qmk_firmware/hotdox-joel/keyboards/hotdox/keymaps/joel/keymap.c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">main file of my config</a>
 here. It's heavily commented and has some nifty ASCII art! It covers 
only the specifics of my personal configuration and doesn't get into any
 of the lower-level stuff common to all Hot Dox QMK firmware.</p>
<p>If you want to dig further into anything you see in that code, I recommend the <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">QMK docs</a>.
 Anything I'm using in my config should be findable in one of the 
sections "Simple Keycodes", "Advanced Keycodes", or "Software Features" 
there.</p>
<h3>"Shooter mode"</h3>
<p>So far none of that is particularly unusual for a custom keyboard 
config, but I did have one personal quirk I needed to take care of. 
Specifically, that my Quake key bindings were going to be unhappy with 
all this.</p>
<p>Back when Doom was released and the guys in my research lab started 
deathmatching, we didn't know about any conventions for setting up our 
key bindings. (Or at least I didn't.) The <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Controls#Default_controls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">default bindings</a> seemed self-evidently bad and the evolutionary pressures of office trash talk made me rethink those pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I started from first principles: I wanted each movement direction key
 under its own finger, plus spacebar for the "use" key (later of course 
for "jump" when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141206105035/http://www.bethblog.com/2010/02/24/the-day-quake-shook-the-gaming-world-carmack-et-al-share-their-qtest-memories/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">QTest</a>
 took over our lab). And I wanted a natural hand position that wouldn't 
give me RSI. If I rotated the keyboard a bit, I could get a nice comfy 
pose with left/right on the A and S keys, forward/backward on Shift and 
Ctrl, and spacebar too. So that was what I went with, for Doom and Quake
 and any similar FPS afterward.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(50% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]weirdo.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]weirdo.jpg" alt="picture of my completely reasonable Quake-playing hand position" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>Not too weird, right? Right?</p>
<p>Well. Even with different key bindings, that hand position just 
wasn't going to fly on the Ergodox layout. The key under the pinky 
wasn't a nice big key anymore, and the thumb key was pretty different 
too. I figured it was time to join the WASD world. I also needed to 
change the keyboard's behavior -- mostly, sacrificing special keys that 
wouldn't be useful anyway while gaming, and making them usable for game 
key binding. That's the "shooter mode" you'll see described <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neogeographica/qmk_firmware/hotdox-joel/keyboards/hotdox/keymaps/joel/keymap.c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">in the config</a>. I like it!</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>You can probably tell that overall I'm happy with how things turned 
out. No complaints yet, really (knock on wood). Two thumbs up.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="[local_images_path()]thumbsup.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="[local_images_path()]thumbsup.jpg" alt="scene from Pulp Fiction, with Jules and Vincent photoshopped as giving thumbs-ups instead of pointing guns" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>I'm pleased to get the SA Carbon keycaps back in action. The MT3 
Godspeeds are fine but the colors and the slicker feel of the SA Carbons
 are more my thing.</p>
<p>Another issue with the Godspeeds BTW is that it was difficult to find
 appropriate keys for the thumb cluster and outer-column positions. The 
Carbon sets made an effort to have a lot of understandably-labelled 
keycaps available for the positions where they might be used, while on 
the other hand the philosophy of the Godspeed sets seems to mostly be: 
eh, if you have an unusual keyboard layout, you can just use keycaps 
that have "fun" words on them. So for example on the Carbon keyboard my 
volume control keys are labelled "Vol-" and "Vol+", while on the 
Godspeed keyboard they are "LWR" and "Fuel". I have keys marked "Tab" 
and "Control" on the Carbon keyboard, but for Godspeed I had to go with 
"Stage" and "Orbit". Etc.</p>
<p>(And for some of the mode-modifier keys I couldn't find anything I 
really liked at all in Godspeed. I ended up pirating some blank keys 
from Carbon since IMO that orange complements the Godspeed colors.)</p>
<p>It's not a usability issue for me since I'm super familiar with 
which-keys-are-where after doing so much work with the configuration. It
 just seems... overly cute? I dunno. It's fine. :-)</p>
<p>As for the switches, I'm enjoying the clicky ones a lot. Probably no 
way I could use these in an open-plan office though! It may just be 
novelty, since I spent so long on quieter switches before now? We'll 
see.</p>
<p>Of course the promise of hotswap boards is that you can try out 
different switches from time to time, but I can see now that's not a 
trivial operation. I mean, of course it's easier than desoldering 
everything, but the switch removal requires a bit of care and force. 
It's going to be quite a while before I'll be in the frame of mind where
 I want to yank all the keycaps and switches from one of these boards 
and then re-assemble it.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I think these particular project demons have been exorcised. I wonder what's next?</p>
