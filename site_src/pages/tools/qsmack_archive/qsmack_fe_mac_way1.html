<H1><FONT SIZE=+4>Q</FONT>Smack Frontend with a Double-Click: Method 1</H1>
<HR>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
So you don't want to (or can't) just download the file?
</P>
<P>
To create the file yourself, you need to have the &quot;Drag &amp; Drop Tclets&quot; application, which comes with the Tcl8.0/Tk8.0 distribution and maybe earlier versions as well.  Use it like so:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Drag qsmack.tcl onto the application.
<LI>The first time you run &quot;Drag &amp; Drop Tclets&quot;, it will ask you to identify the &quot;Wish stub to clone&quot;.  Use the dialog box to select the Wish application that came with your Tcl/Tk distribution.
<LI>Finally, it will ask you the &quot;name and location of your target Tcl application&quot;.  This is the new double-clickable QSmack frontend that you are creating.  Use the dialog box to navigate to the folder where you want to put it, and give it a creative name like &quot;QSmackFE&quot;.
</UL>
<P>
Ta da.  All done.  You have now created a new application that you can double-click to launch the QSmack frontend.
</P>
