<H1><FONT SIZE=+4>Q</FONT>Smack Frontend with a Double-Click: Method 2</H1>
<HR>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
So you don't want to (or can't) just download the files?
</P>
<P>
To make the changes yourself, you need to have and know how to use ResEdit.  If you don't, please don't ask us about this; just use the other method instead.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Change the creator type of qsmack.tcl to be &quot;WIsH&quot;.  (Yes, that's the correct capitalization.)
<LI>Add a TEXT resource to your Wish application and name it &quot;tclshrc&quot;.  The contents of this resource should be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
proc tkOpenDocument args {
    foreach file $args {
        uplevel #0 source \&quot;$file\&quot;
    }
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Quit out of ResEdit, saving your changes to both files.
</UL>
<P>
Now double-clicking on qsmack.tcl should launch the QSmack frontend.
</P>
<BR/>
