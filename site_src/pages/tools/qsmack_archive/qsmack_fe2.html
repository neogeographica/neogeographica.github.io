<P>
<B>Before you continue:</B>  Remember we said that the QSmack frontend is written in Tcl?  More specifically, to use the frontend you must have Tcl7.6/Tk4.2</A> or a more recent version installed on your computer. If you don't have Tcl/Tk installed you may as well get the latest version, <A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/">(Currently Tcl8.3/Tk8.3)</A>.  If you need to, stop right now and go get it before continuing.  The installation process is laughably simple, and it is available for Windows, Macintosh, and various flavors of UNIX.

<P>
Once you have Tcl/Tk installed, using the QSmack frontend is as easy as 1-2-3 (pardon the cliché):
