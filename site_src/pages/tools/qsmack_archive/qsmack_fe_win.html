Once you unzip the archive, put the qsmackfe.tcl program and libtcl_qsmackfe.dll in the <B>same</B> directory where they will permanently reside. You can delete &quot;tcl_qsmackfe.c&quot since the .dll file is the same thing - just in compiled form. This DLL gives the frontend the ability to execute the <A HREF="qsmack_fe_comm.html#nslookup">nslookup</A> command.
</P>
<P>
The best way to run the frontend is to create a shortcut that contains the proper command line. This is what we do. We have two shortcuts. One that starts the frontend with a &quot;high res&quot; config file and another that starts it with a &quot;low res&quot; config file depending on the resolution of the monitor that we're using.
</P>
<P>
Here is the command line we use for the &quot;high res&quot version:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
q:\tcl\bin\wish8.0.exe q:\qsmack\tcl\qsmackfe.tcl q:/qsmack/tcl/qsmackfe.cfg.highres
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
And likewise for the &quot;low res&quot; version:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
q:\tcl\bin\wish8.0.exe q:\qsmack\tcl\qsmackfe.tcl q:/qsmack/tcl/qsmackfe.cfg.lowres
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Notice that the full filename of the config files are specified with <B>forward</B> slashes. This is very important.
</P>
<P>
You get the picture.  For now, set up a shortcut so that the frontend will use the &quot;qsmackfe.cfg.quickstart&quot; config file.  You can try more complicated config files once you've verified that everything works.
</P>
<P>
Double-click on the shortcut to get started...
