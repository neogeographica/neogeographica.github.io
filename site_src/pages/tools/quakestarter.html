  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Over 20 years after Quake's release, there's still an amazing amount of creativity being put into maintaining and improving &quot;Quake engines&quot; (Quake-playing programs), content authoring tools, and new maps and mods. If you haven't been keeping up with developments over the years though, it can be difficult to get up to speed to the point where you are actually playing fun new stuff.</p>
  <p>I spent some time <a href="[docs_guides_home_path]">writing guides</a> to collect relevant info, but that doesn't really lower the entrance bar very much, especially when it comes to figuring out how to play custom content. A true &quot;Quake for dummies&quot; installer would be a great thing to have and be able to give to newbies. This isn't quite that, but it's getting closer.</p>
  <h2>Contents</h2>
  <p>Here's what this package includes:</p>
  <ul>
  	  <li>the <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake">vkQuake</a> and <a href="https://github.com/andrei-drexler/ironwail">Ironwail</a> Quake engines</li>
  	  <li>the <a href="https://github.com/m-x-d/Simple-Quake-Launcher-2/releases/latest">Simple Quake Launcher 2</a> front-end</li>
  	  <li>the Quakestarter utility that can find pak files on your local system, install soundtrack music files, and install &amp; launch a selection of maps and mods</li>
  	  <li>documentation about configuring and running Quake</li>
  	  <li>documentation about finding/installing/launching maps and mods</li>
  	  <li>even more info on other topics!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The documentation is there as a fallback if something doesn't work, or if you want to learn more about a topic. The actual process of getting up and running is fairly simple as described in the &quot;How to use this&quot; section of the <a href="https://neogeographica.com/quakestarter_readme.html">first page of the docs</a>.</p>
  <h2>Why vkQuake/Ironwail?</h2>
  <p>It's fair to ask why any Quake engine should be included in this package, and why vkQuake and Ironwail are the ones I chose.</p>
  <p>To answer that first part, I'm trying as much as possible to provide an all-in-one solution that doesn't tell folks to first go download something else. I realize that means that the packaged Quake engines may get out of date, but I think that's the lesser evil.</p>
  <p>As to why choose vkQuake/Ironwail in particular:</p>
  <p>Currently Quakespasm is a sort of &quot;reference standard&quot; for playing new singleplayer map releases, but there are other engines that build on Quakespasm to offer new useful features without sacrificing that basic level of compatibility. vkQuake and Ironwail are two excellent choices in that field. The <a href="https://neogeographica.com/quakestarter_html/other_stuff/quake_engines.html">Quake Engines</a> chapter of the docs has more detail about what vkQuake and Ironwail add to the Quakespasm baseline, and how they differ from each other.</p>
  <h2>Why not the &quot;enhanced&quot; Quake rerelease?</h2>
  <p>The recent rerelease/remaster of Quake is a cool project, and it's a great way to (re)play the original campaign and official missionpacks. It's compatible with some custom map releases as well... but not all. So for the foreseeable future, the best way to play custom singleplayer maps will still be by using a community-developed Quake engine.</p>
  <h2>Why not Quake Injector?</h2>
  <p>The other big question about this package is probably why I included Simple Quake Launcher 2 and wrote the Quakestarter utility instead of just bundling in <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/tools/quake_injector">Quake Injector</a>.</p>
  <p>Quake Injector is great. But since it is a Java application, getting it running correctly is just one more hurdle that a lot of new players falter at. For most Windows users at least, it is easier to get them started using the tools in this package instead of dropping Quake Injector on their heads right off the bat. Quakestarter also has a different focus of &quot;showcase the best stuff and make absolutely sure it painlessly works&quot; as opposed to Quake Injector's mission of being a broad gateway to every release out there.</p>
  <p>For people who want to keep playing and exploring more content, Quake Injector is an undeniably handy tool. I do discuss it in the included documentation on finding and installing more maps &amp; mods.</p>
