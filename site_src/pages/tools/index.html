  <p>This section of the site is a collection of tools that I've fiddled with over the years for creating and using Quake, Quake 3, and Quake Live game content. They're not usually in super-user-friendly form, but there's enough of a trickle of interest in them that I think it's good to keep them around.</p>
  <p>Use the right-hand navigation bar to investigate further. Let me know if you have any questions or problems, or if you're looking for something that I haven't made a page for here yet.</p>
