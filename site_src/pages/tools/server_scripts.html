<h1>Gameserver Scripts</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>runscripts and Webmin plugin for dedicated gameservers</li>
    <li>tested in Debian Linux</li>
    <li>some assembly required</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are the scripts I use to run the Quake and Quake 3 servers for our local LAN. They are <em>not</em> in an easy-to-use package; you'll need shell scripting and Linux administration experience to make any use of this stuff. Which of course means that this is the sort of thing you could just figure out yourself! But I'm not making this repository public as a servers-for-dummies appliance; instead I think that a) having it available for reference could still be helpful to some folks (it would have been helpful for me), b) there's the off chance that I can get feedback about something I could fix or improve, and c) why not.</p>
