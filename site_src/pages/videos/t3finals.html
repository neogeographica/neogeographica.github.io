<h1>ClanRing T3 Finals Game</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>ClanRing Tournament 3 low-ping bracket finals</li>
    <li>game 2, D11-Thresh POV</li>
    <li>played January 1998; this rendering: September 2013</li>
  </ul>
  <p>ClanRing Tournament 3 was the first big cross-continental Quake tournament in North America, and arguably the peak of Quake tournament competition before QuakeWorld took over as the common way to play. It was divided into high-ping and low-ping brackets. The low-ping finalists were Unforgiven (east coast) and Death Row (west coast); they played the finals match at a LAN. This video is game 2 of the match from the POV of Thresh on the Death Row team, with a few additions to make it more watchable; more about those changes below.</p>
  <p>(Note that if you watch the video on YouTube rather than embedded here, you can choose to see it in 1280x720 resolution.)</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This video was one of those &quot;one thing leads to another&quot; projects.</p>
  <p>During the tournament in 1997, as the match demos were released I edited them to put a unique &quot;jersey&quot; (player model skin) on each player, as described on the <a href="[docs_attic_home_path]t3demos.html">T3 Demos</a> page. The final match was delayed though, and by the time it eventually happened I was on to other things and didn't do anything with its demos.</p>
  <p>When I was recently collecting those edited T3 demos to put them in the Attic section here, I thought it would be nice to finish what I had started (as much as possible) and tackle the demos from the finals. Unfortunately the demos from the high-ping finals are nowhere to be found, game 1 of the low-ping finals is also AWOL, and game 3 is a blowout. Game 2 is a pretty good game though! I like it as a snapshot of pre-QuakeWorld DM3 teamplay. So here it is in video form.</p>
  <p>The Unforgiven team:</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>player</th><th>jersey number</th><th>highlight color</th></tr>
    <tr><td>gOLluM</td><td>0</td><td>white</td></tr>
    <tr><td>batch</td><td>1</td><td>red</td></tr>
    <tr><td>graphik</td><td>2</td><td>blue</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thorn</td><td>3</td><td>yellow</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>The Death Row team:</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>player</th><th>jersey number</th><th>highlight color</th></tr>
    <tr><td>B2</td><td>0</td><td>white</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Spear</td><td>1</td><td>red</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thresh</td><td>2</td><td>blue</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Unholy</td><td>3</td><td>yellow</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>(Each player also has the same number of helmet markings as their jersey number.)</p>
  <p>It turns out that the unique-jersey idea really is more of a help in a) chasecam demos (it makes it obvious when the camera switches) and b) high resolution demo viewing. In a first-person YouTube video it doesn't seem to add much. As I was fiddling with the video I thought that the main things it was missing, for watchability, were a game countdown timer and a running scoreboard. So I layered those in. I also removed a few message prints from the upper left corner (things like observers entering and leaving the game) but left the usual chat and kill messages intact.</p>
  <p>One thing I can't fix is that the YouTube re-encoding of the video is blurrier than I'd like, even in the 720p version. And the original movie file is large enough that I won't host it here for download. But if you get the demo from the <a href="[docs_attic_home_path]t3demos.html">T3 Demos</a> page, you can play it back yourself in your preferred Quake engine.</p>
