    <li>Quake 3 CTF &amp; Team Arena, 8-12 players</li>
    <li>in development?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In 2010 I started poking around at another Q3 CTF map.  I had a lot of fun with the layout, grayboxing, and playtesting phases, but then my schedule changed around and my mapping momentum was over. If/when I take another run at Q3 mapping this will probably be what I pick back up. With those other maps under my belt, this should be the one that I get right, yeah?</p>
