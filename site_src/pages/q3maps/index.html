  <p>This section contains the maps (gameplay environments) I've made for use with Quake 3.  You'll need your own copy of Quake 3 to play them, and it likely needs to be patched up to a recent version. If you don't know how to use an add-on map with Quake 3, I'll defer explaining that to other websites; one resource is the FAQ page at the excellent site <a href="http://lvlworld.com/howtoplay">LvL</a>.</p>
  <p>For the CTF maps, I've also made versions that can be used for playing against bots in <a href="http://www.quakelive.com/">Quake Live</a>. These are quick conversions that did not change the look or layout of the map; I just felt it would be a shame not to make the maps usable in what is essentially a free version of Quake 3. Each of the Quake Live download packages comes with a readme file that explains how to use the map with Quake Live and lists the known issues.</p>
  <p>Use the right-hand navigation bar to select a map.</p>
