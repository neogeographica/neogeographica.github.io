  <p>This section contains the maps (gameplay environments) I've made for use with Quake 3 and Quake Live.</p>
  <p>To play one of these maps in Quake 3: You'll need your own copy of Quake 3, patched up to its final version. The map package zipfile that you download from this site will include a ".pk3" file that is required to play the map with Quake 3. If you don't know how to use an add-on map with Quake 3, I'll defer explaining that to other websites; one resource is the FAQ page at the excellent site <a href="http://lvlworld.com/howtoplay">LvL</a>.</p>
  <p>Two of these maps are also available in Quake Live. One map (Industrial Revolution) is included with Quake Live, and another (Titans) is available through the Steam Workshop for Quake Live. For playing a map in Quake Live, you don't need to download anything from my site here.</p>
  <p>Use the right-hand navigation bar to select a map.</p>
