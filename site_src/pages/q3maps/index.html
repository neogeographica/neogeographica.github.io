  <p>This section contains the maps (gameplay environments) I've made for use with Quake 3.  You'll need your own copy of Quake 3 to play them, and it likely needs to be patched up to a recent version. If you don't know how to use an add-on map with Quake 3, I'll defer explaining that to other websites; one resource is the FAQ page at the excellent site <a href="http://lvlworld.com/howtoplay">LvL</a>.</p>
  <p>Use the right-hand navigation bar to select a map.</p>
