  <p>See the right-hand navigation bar to select a guide topic.</p>
  <p>A few things to note up front:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>These guides are all for Quake... not Quake 2 or Quake 3.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Originally these were posted to the Steam community content for Quake. The guide pages on this site are an automated conversion from Steam's BBCode markup.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The vast majority of the info in these guides applies to <em>any</em> Quake installation, not only the stuff you get from Steam. I just added a few Steam-specific tips to help those folks along.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These guides should still be on-point for handling the original Quake engines. But when it comes to the specific features of modern Quake engines, I've let these guides get out of date. There's some <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2310/discussions/0/35219681507236923/?tscn=1466635875#c358415738182797786">errata</a> posted over on the Steam forums but that may be getting stale at this point too.</p>
  <p>I'm not sure when/if I'll be in the frame of mind for a grand rewrite of this stuff. My &quot;help folks play Quake&quot; energy is entirely taken up by the <a href="[docs_tools_home_path]quakestarter.html">Quake Singleplayer Starter Pack</a> currently, which is a project that is a bit more focussed and practical.</p>
  <p>Regardless, if you've got comments about the guide contents you can still send me an email, especially if you see some info about the original Quake engines that needs correcting.</p>
