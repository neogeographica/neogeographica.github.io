tmyk.jpg is of course a screen grab from those old NBC PSAs.

The 32x32 icons are from each of the relevant Quake engines on Windows.

Everything else is a screenshot by me.

Note that screenshot1.jpg - screenshot4.jpg are four images from my Quake screenshots on Steam; the guide references them using other links.
