qgear.jpg is my modification of a free image (gear.jpg) from Wikimedia Commons.

tmyk.jpg is of course a screen grab from those old NBC PSAs.

The 32x32 icons are from each of the relevant Quake engines on Windows.

qhd1.jpg and qhd2.jpg are from the Quake HD page on ModDB.

id1_screenshot2_large.jpg and mp1_screenshot2_large.jpg are from the old Quake Epsilon website (http://www.xpfree.org/epsilon/).
