quakenote3.png is my composition of a free "note" image from Wikimedia Commons, a free snippet of Bach music notation from Wikimedia commons, a vector graphic of the Quake logo, and scans of the cover of the Quake CD case.

tmyk.jpg is of course a screen grab from those old NBC PSAs.

track02-ogg.png and track02-deemph-ogg.png were generated by me using Spek.
