<p>When we last saw our hero, he had built his first mechanical 
keyboard. And looking upon his creation, he saw that indeed it was 
pretty sweet.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/07+old+board.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/07+old+board.jpg" alt="my Infinity Ergodox build, outfitted with SA Carbon keycaps" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>Then it broke.</p></div><div class="co-prose prose my-4 overflow-hidden break-words px-3"><hr>
<p>Well, let's back up a bit. When I first got the kit in late 2017 and 
put it together with the temporary DSA Granite keycaps, I started using 
it as my "daily driver" for work. At the time I worked at a startup that
 was renting space over a restaurant, not exactly a secure place to 
leave stuff overnight. So I carted the keyboard back and forth, plugging
 and unplugging it from my laptop, and folding the two "hands" with 
their connecting cable into a little carrying bag. When the SA Carbon 
keycaps arrived, I swapped those in and kept up with my commute habits.</p>
<p>In the meantime I was fiddling with the keyboard's configuration to 
get the key layout and modes/features dialed in juuuust the way I 
wanted. I went through a dozen revisions over about a year of use.</p>
<p>And in late 2018, it stopped working.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(50% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/08+sad+mister+t.gif" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/08+sad+mister+t.gif" alt="Mr. T, a single tear running down his face" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>When I had received the kit, the USB connectors (for the cable 
between "hands" and for board-to-computer) were already surface-mounted 
to the circuit boards. They weren't braced/supported by the case in any 
way, just kind of accessible through a hole in the back. I didn't think 
anything of that at the time.</p>
<p>I like to think I'm not a brute to my electronics, but I guess my 
daily routine stressed the connectors anyway. Eventually one of them 
broke mostly free of the circuit board and some of the others were 
getting wobbly. Here's a couple of views of the most problematic one; 
normally the top side of it would have been flush with that little metal
 bracket:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(50% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/09+old+connector+1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/09+old+connector+1.jpg" alt="bottom view of USB-C connector, tilted at a nonfunctional angle" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a></figure><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(50% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/10+old+connector+2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/10+old+connector+2.jpg" alt="top view of connector, showing separation from bracket" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>To get access to these connectors for a repair attempt, I'd have to 
desolder all the switches. Then I'd need to find a way to replace 
surface-mounted parts, which was not in my toolbag or skillset. I 
couldn't get a good lead on the surface-mounting part of the problem so I
 didn't even start on the desoldering.</p>
<p>While I was spinning my wheels on that, another Ergodox kit became available -- the <a href="https://kono.store/products/ergodox-hotdox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">"Hot Dox"</a>
 -- which didn't require soldering switches. I figured I would drown my 
sorrows in a couple of those. I could rescue the keycaps from the first 
board, try out a different keycaps design too (<a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-mt3-godspeed-custom-keycap-set" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">MT3 Godspeed</a>), and experiment with different switch types.</p>
<p>A few issues needed solving before I could do the builds though.</p>
<p>Then we welcomed a daughter into our family.</p>
<p>Then we bought a house and moved.</p>
<p>By this time my various unfinished projects were boxed and packed 
away like the end scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the know-how and 
motivation for them fading away. The amount of time, thought, expense, 
and effort sunk into this one did pester me though. So before all the 
relevant bits completely fell out of my head -- as mentioned way back at
 the start of part 1 -- I decided to take some holiday break time to 
bring it to the finish line.</p>
<p>OK! What were those aforementioned issues to solve?</p>
<h3>Connector bracing</h3>
<p>One thing for sure, I didn't want the USB connectors to pull free of 
the board again. And when I got the Hot Dox boards, they had the exact 
same potential issue as the Infinity Ergodox. It seemed like it would be
 a good idea to put something above and below each connector to brace it
 against the case. But if the bracing substance was too soft it wouldn't
 help; too hard and I'd have to precisely shape it. Another question was
 how to get it to stick in place without looking ugly.</p>
<p>In the end I used "bumpons" of various heights. These are the little 
clear rubber domes, with adhesive along the flat side, usually used as 
stick-on feet for things (such as keyboards, incidentally). I had four 
different sized gaps to deal with; for two of them I found a good 
matching bumpon, one of them was filled pretty well by a bumpon sitting 
on two layers of 7 mil electrical tape, and one gap (the least visible) I
 just filled with 9 layers of that tape.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/11+new+board+connectors.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/11+new+board+connectors.jpg" alt="USB-A and USB-C connectors, braced against case with bumpons and electrical tape" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>I'm not actually sure how effective this will be, but it feels reassuring.</p>
<p>Incidentally, when gathering pictures for these posts, I noticed that
 the Infinity Ergodox page at drop.com has been updated at least once 
since the buy that I participated in. And it looks like in later 
revisions of that keyboard kit they have addressed the connector 
stability, at least for the USB-C ports:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/12+new+infinity.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/12+new+infinity.jpeg" alt="new Infinity Ergodox board with nicely secured USB-C port, too late for me" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>Which doesn't help me now, of course, but it probably means I wasn't especially unlucky or abusive with my board.</p>
<h3>LEDs</h3>
<p>Another issue was the lack of an LCD screen to provide feedback about
 the keyboard state. I would have to take this into account in 
configuration, but first I needed to see what kind of feedback 
indicators I <em>could</em> get from the keyboard.</p>
<p>From looking into the configuration code it seemed like there were 
three LEDs that could be turned on/off. Interrogating a company rep 
helped me find the appropriate LED pads, but it was a little odd because
 it looked like any LEDs there would be obstructed by the plate above 
the circuit board that held the switches. Also I had no indication on 
what size and voltage of LED to use.</p>
<p>After a little experimentation I decided to go with some 1.8mm LEDs 
of the kind that would normally be used for per-key lighting. Even these
 tiny boys wouldn't quite fit under the switch plate if standing 
straight up, but when bent over at an angle they kinda did:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/13+new+board+LEDs.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/13+new+board+LEDs.jpg" alt="LEDs in place, tilted to fit under switch plate" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>That's a red, green, and blue LED. We'll check later how useful-in-practice they'll be as indicator lights.</p>
<h3>Switches</h3>
<p>The Ergodox key layout has "thumb clusters" of keys, and usually the 
big keys in those clusters will be used for common things like space, 
backspace, enter, and shift. Using the sides of my thumbs to hit these 
keys was no worse than for a "normal" spacebar I guess, but at least 
with my Infinity Ergodox it had felt like I was putting too much side 
force on my thumb joint. So back when I ordered the switches for the two
 new kits, I had decided to use slightly-easier-to-push switches for the
 keys in the thumb cluster, and also for the outer column "pinky" keys 
while I was at it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I hadn't really recorded my decision anywhere or marked
 what I had received, so in the present day I was left staring at a 
bunch of bags like this:</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/14+switch+bags.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/14+switch+bags.jpg" alt="bags ' switches in a cardboard box" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>A bit of detective work from old receipts, card statements, and 
serial-numbers-on-bags cleared things up though. I believe I ended up 
with the following types -- which probably aren't the new hotness 
anymore! but still perfectly fine:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Input_Club_Hako" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Hako Clear</a>, a non-clicky switch for the "main" keys of one board</li>
<li>Hako Violet, also non-clicky, a lighter switch for the "outer" keys of that board</li>
<li><a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Kailh_BOX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Kailh BOX Navy</a>, a clicky switch for the "main" keys of the other board</li>
<li>Kailh BOX Jade, also clicky, a lighter switch for the "outer" keys of that board</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining switches-related issue was getting their leads into the
 appropriate tiny spring-clamps on these "hotswap" boards. Sure, not 
needing to solder is nice, but until you get a feel for exactly how to 
jam these dudes into their sockets you can roll up one of the the switch
 leads like a New Year's party blower.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(100% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/15+bad+lead.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/15+bad+lead.jpg" alt="switch with one lead rolled up from a bad insertion" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<p>A magnifying lens helps in checking that the lead-tips have made it 
through, and once every switch is in place a test program like <a href="https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/switch_hitter.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Switch Hitter</a> can be useful to make sure that all your switches are behaving. Eventually, without destroying <em>too</em> many switches, I had the boards ready for keycaps.</p>
<div style="align-items: stretch; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-evenly; line-height: 100%; text-shadow: black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px, black 0px 0px 2px;"><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(33.3333% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/16+mag.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/16+mag.jpg" alt="examining back of circuit board with a magnifying lens" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a></figure><figure style="display: block; margin: 2px; position: relative; text-decoration: none; width: calc(66.6666% - 4px);"><a href="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/17+switches+in.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0"><img src="../../../images/attic/kbd_archive/../kbd/17+switches+in.jpg" alt="top of keyboard with switches all inserted" style="height: 100%; margin: 0px; object-fit: cover; width: 100%;"></a></figure></div>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously my Infinity Ergodox used <a href="https://kiibohd.github.io/wiki/#/Quickstart" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">Kiibohd</a> firmware for its configuration. For the Hot Dox though, I needed to use <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" tabindex="0">QMK</a> instead.</p>
<p>The thought of redoing my laboriously-tuned configuration from 
scratch in a different system -- and the inevitable subsequent debugging
 -- was another source of project inertia, but I give major kudos to 
Past Joel for going ahead with the "QMK port" while the config was still
 fresh in my head. Even without any actual keyboard to test it on.</p>
<p>Once I did get the keyboards ready to flash and test, I dug out that 
speculatively-written QMK config from years ago and it basically just 
worked! Although I still did end up revving it a few times to iron out 
some quirks and take advantage of QMK features. While QMK does (like 
Kiibohd) support doing some straightforward "map this key to this 
action" config, it also allows you to get in there and just start 
writing C code to manage some stuff if you like. Which is catnip to 
certain kinds of people, cough cough.</p>
<p>This post has gone on long enough so I'll end it here, leaving the 
details of the configuration and some other final observations to a <a href="post3.html">third and final post</a> in this sequence. But to close here, let's take a look at a couple of years-old newly completed keyboards!</p>
