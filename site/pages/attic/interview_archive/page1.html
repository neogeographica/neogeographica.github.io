                is running 2 Q3Atest servers right now at kitty1.stanford.edu:{27690,27691}

                Clan</a>. They're graduate students in EE and CS at Stanford University

              <p><b><img src="../../../images/attic/interview_archive/../interview/bullet3.gif" border="0" height="11" width="13">PQ: 
                How did you guys get started with Quake?</b></p>
              <p><i>ahnuld</i>: 
                Some of the guys were playing Qtest and just around that time, 
                our entire group moved into a brand new building. As a consequence 
                of that, Intel donated dozens and dozens of Pentium 120s to the 
                department. Our group ended up with a few and they also populated 
                an entire room in the basement and gave us access to them. The 
                intended use of that room was not as a Quake Lab, but that's what 
                it turned into. We had all these machines (which were considered 
                fast at the time) and everyone just started getting into it because 
                eight of us could play at LAN speeds all in the same room. It 
                was pretty cool. It was about that time that we decided to start 
                our own server so that we could play against other people when 
                our friends weren't around. The first kitty1 server was just a 
                plain old Pentium 120. We publicized kitty1 on Stomped and people 
                just started showing up.</p>
              <p><img style="margin-right: 3px" src="../../../images/attic/interview_archive/../interview/c9_logo.gif" width="100" height="100" align="left"><i>lemurboy</i>: 
                Yeah, quite a few of the graphics students were into Qtest MP, 
                but most of us in the systems group (this was a little before 
                ahnuld's time) were still &quot;busy&quot; with Doom2 on our SGI workstations. 
                I remember the first time I saw Qtest... I was just awestruck 
                by the fact that they were doing true 3D scene rendering so quickly, 
                and I loved how it made you feel like You Were There. I would 
                run around in the levels alone just looking around and getting 
                goosebumps thinking about how cool the game was going to be. :-) 
                But at that time, those of us in the systems group didn't really 
                have a network of PCs to play on, and setting up Qtest matches 
                was pretty yicky, so we didn't fool with it much. As soon as Quake 
                was out though, we picked it up, and when the Internet play possibilities 
                opened up -- and then we got the Quake Lab delivered to us like 
                an Act of God -- we were hooked and gone.</p>
              <p><b><img src="../../../images/attic/interview_archive/../interview/bullet3.gif" border="0" height="11" width="13">PQ: 
                Why do you think kitty1 became popular?</b></p>
              <p><i>ahnuld</i>: 
                I'd like to say it was because of lemurboy's awesome administrating 
                abilities but I think Stanford's massive pipe to the main backbone 
                and central location in Northern California also had something 
                to do with it. Also, after we had been running for a while, Intel 
                decided to donate *eight* Quad Pentium II 200's to the graphics 
                department. Well, since half of our clan was in graphics, we were 
                able to &quot;procure&quot; one of those boxes. With this new box, we were 
                able to run many Quake servers at once with no noticeable performance 
                problems.</p>
              <p><i>lemurboy</i>: 
                It's always handy to have your servers be at the top of the ping 
                list for everyone, and we had excellent server uptime so they 
                stayed there. That in itself attracted a lot of the best players, 
                especially from west-coast clans, so usually we'd have a few players 
                on from Legends, XP, Postal, and so forth (I'm probably forgetting 
                someone). And not even using fake names, imagine that! That made 
                for a snowball effect of sorts... great players want to play with 
                great players (and the not-so-great players want to hang out with 
                them too). Since none of our clan except for xris probably qualified 
                as &quot;great players&quot;, we needed the draw from those other clans. 
                :-)</p>
              <p><b><img src="../../../images/attic/interview_archive/../interview/bullet3.gif" border="0" height="11" width="13">PQ: 
                What did you guys do about the inevitable lamers that showed up? 
                </b></p>
              <p><i>ahnuld</i>: 
                I'll handle this one! Firstly, we were actually playing quite 
                a lot back then, and never underestimate how good a 3ms ping can 
                make you, so our first line of defense against lamers has always 
                been the demoralizing beatdown.</p>
              <p>However, 
                along came a certain unnamed copycat clan that also resided at 
                Stanford and our ping advantage disappeared. The worst part about 
                this clan was their insistence of ignoring our stated server rules. 
                These guys were the biggest trash talking, fouled mouthed idiots 
                that you've ever seen. Also about this time, our friends in the 
                graphics department were developing the evil StoogeBot and I was 
                able to leverage their network code to write an auto client who 
                would stay in the game at all times with admin privileges, so 
                you could ask it to kick or ban people who were unruly. This tool 
                became known as <a href="../../../pages/tools/qsmack.html">QSmack</a>. 
                When I first starting writing QSmack, I only intended on it being 
                a way to talk to players in the game. However, when these hooligans 
                showed up, we knew that QSmack's true purpose was to ban lamers!</p>
              <p>It was kind 
                of funny, because in the beginning, QSmack had many bugs and didn't 
                always prevent the banned players from connecting to the server. 
                I specifically remember an episode where I was busily hacking 
                away on QSmack and one of the other C9ers was playing in a room 
                across the hall from my office. He was shouting at me how the 
                members of clan idiot were scoffing at our &quot;admin bot&quot; because 
                it only kept them out for one level and they could reconnect at 
                the next level change. They were doing the debugging for me! With 
                that feedback, I was able to track down (with lemurboy's help) 
                the bug and quickly put a fix in. Within 5 minutes, clan idiot 
                couldn't connect at all! It was hilarious. We would disable the 
                bot on purpose and let them reconnect, they would think they found 
                a new bug and we would taunt them some more and reban them! It 
                was fantastic.</p>
              <p>From then 
                on, QSmack proved to be invaluable. We added the ability to ban 
                another player while you yourself were playing and it was an instant 
                hit with everybody in the clan. If you were playing a game and 
                someone started acting up, you bring down the console, type a 
                few commands, and they were permanently gone. It was beautiful.</p>
