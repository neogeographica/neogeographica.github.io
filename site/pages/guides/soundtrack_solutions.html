  <h2 id="01">The Problem With CD Audio</h2>
  <p>As originally released, Quake played its soundtrack music using CD audio.  Each track was actually a track on the CD itself (starting with track 2; track 1 contained the game data).  The soundtrack music was never installed to your hard drive as a file.</p><p>The problem with that now is that if you get Quake through digital distribution, you don't get a CD.  So no music.</p><p>Of course, if you have an original Quake CD from back in the day, and it's still readable, then you might be good to go.  Or you might not be &ndash; the original Quake engines, and some (or all?) modern Quake engines, will not properly loop the music tracks when used under Windows Vista or Windows 7.  And there are plenty of other reasons you might not want to mess with a physical CD anyway.</p><p>Fortunately there are several ways to manage without a physical CD and still hear the good old creepy Quake music while you play.</p>  <h2 id="02">Soundtrack Files</h2>
  <p>For any of these solutions to work, you do first have to get either a Quake CD image or ripped music tracks from somewhere.  If you don't have a physical Quake CD then there are all sorts of ways to buy or borrow one, and likewise there are various ways to get a CD image or the ripped tracks.  For example:</p><p><ul><li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/2310/discussions/0/882966056497559791/">A thread on the Steam forums</a> provides download links for CD images of the music tracks, and also for ripped soundtrack files in OGG (Ogg Vorbis) format.<br/></li><li>The quakeone.com forums provide <a href="http://quakeone.com/forums/quake-mod-releases/finished-works/7337-high-quality-music-packs.html">soundtrack files in OGG format</a>.<br/></li><li>Quaddicted also provides <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/files/music/">soundtrack files in OGG format</a>.<br/></li></ul></p><p>And if you're using a bundle package of Quake stuff that has been assembled by someone else, it may already include a soundtrack:</p><p><ul><li>The <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-hd-pack-guide">Quake HD</a> bundle includes soundtrack files in OGG format, along with the DarkPlaces engine and a bunch of other new textures and sounds.<br/></li><li>The <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923">&ldquo;Ultimate Quake Patch&rdquo;</a> includes soundtrack files in OGG format, along with an older version of the DarkPlaces engine and a few other things.<br/></li><li>The <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-epsilon-build">Quake Epsilon</a> bundle also includes the DarkPlaces engine and OGG-format music, although in this case the music is a set of replacement/alternative selections rather than the original Quake soundtrack.<br/></li></ul></p><p>(And the sources above also provide soundtracks for the Quake mission packs.)</p><p>So before going any further in this guide you should have either soundtrack files, a physical CD, or a CD image. If you have soundtrack files you can skip to the next section (although you may also want to check out the &ldquo;More You Know&rdquo; box below).</p><p>If you have a CD image then you need some sort of virtual CD software to &ldquo;mount&rdquo; the image, so that applications see it as a real CD.  <a href="http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html">Virtual Clone Drive</a> is popular but there are lots of choices.</p><p>Now, you could just mount the CD image and then let Quake play music from it as if it were a physical CD.  But that approach is a bit of a hassle and it suffers from the same no-looping problem as real CDs.  So let's not do that!</p><p>Instead we're going to go with solutions that play music files from your hard disk, one file for each of the music tracks from the CD.  If you don't already have the Quake soundtrack in this form, then you should take either the physical CD or mounted CD image and rip the tracks from it into music files.  Once you have those files, you no longer need the CD or image.</p><p>The format that you rip to does matter, as the various solutions below support different music file formats.  Generally speaking though, OGG files are widely supported.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-233460" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> Audio buffs may want to take note that the music on the Quake CD is &ldquo;pre-emphasized&rdquo;.  The hydrogenaudio wiki has a <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Pre-emphasis">summary of pre-emphasis</a> that is worth a look.  The upshot is that to make the playback sound exactly correct, the ripped files need to have been processed with a specific equalization curve to get rid of the pre-emphasis.<br/><br/>Ripping a CD with iTunes will handle such &ldquo;de-emphasis&rdquo; automatically.  The hydrogenaudio wiki page has some tips about other ripping methods, and Google will also turn up good discussion about this.<br/><br/>The difference between Quake tracks that have been properly de-emphasized and those that haven't is fairly subtle to my old ears.  If you are in the mood to decode a spectral analysis, here's a comparison of a ripped file of the first Quake track not de-emphasized (top) vs. de-emphasized (bottom):<br/><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/track02-ogg.png" id="trigger-237579" class="guidePic sizeThumb inline" /><br/><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/track02-deemph-ogg.png" id="trigger-237578" class="guidePic sizeThumb inline" /><br/><br/>The general effect of de-emphasis is to have more of a contrast in volume between the low and high frequencies.<br/><br/>If you didn't rip the tracks yourself and you don't know whether or not they have been de-emphasized&#8230; well, they probably haven't been, but you might not want to lose sleep over it.  Just something to keep in mind.<br/><br/>The music files included in <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-hd-pack-guide">Quake HD</a> and in the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923">&ldquo;Ultimate Quake Patch&rdquo;</a> have <em>not</em> been de-emphasized. I haven't checked the other sources mentioned above.</blockquote></p>  <h2 id="03">Playing the Soundtrack</h2>
  <p>There are multiple approaches to using Quake soundtrack files.  What's the right one for you?  It depends on which Quake engine you are using.  If that sentence confuses you, then first have a look at this guide: <a href="engines.html"><img src="../../images/guides/common/neo.png" class="linkBadge"></img> Quake Engines, Old and New</a><br/><br/></p><h3>&bull; Engines that don't have soundtrack support</h3><p>The ProQuake engine as of version 4.91beta no longer supports any kind of soundtrack playback, not even CD audio.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Engines that only support CD audio</h3><p>The original Quake engines (the ones that Steam downloads for you) only support CD audio.  If you want to get them to play music files instead, then you will have to modify them.  I haven't tried this approach myself, but Dragonsbrethren has posted a guide: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113399618"><img src="../../images/guides/common/steam.png" class="linkBadge"></img> How to fix CD audio looping on Windows Vista/7</a><br/><br/>Most modern Quake engines also still support CD audio, so there is a good chance that any such modification would also work on them.  However if the engine can manage one of the other solutions below, then it would probably be better to use that other solution.  It's just generally nicer not to need to binary-patch your Quake executable (and then have to do it again if you ever download an updated version).<br/></p><h3>&bull; Engines that play soundtrack music files</h3><p>Several modern Quake engines will play soundtrack music files at the appropriate times as long as you 1) name the files in a certain way and 2) put the files in a certain place.</p><p>Among the choices listed in the &ldquo;Quake Engines&rdquo; guide, the following engines support playing these formats of music files:</p><p><ul><li><a href="http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/">DarkPlaces</a>: OGG, WAV<br/></li><li><a href="http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/">QuakeSpasm</a>: OGG, MP3<strong>*</strong>, WAV<br/></li><li><a href="http://celephais.net/board/view_thread.php?id=60831">FitzQuake Mark V</a>: MP3<br/></li><li><a href="http://directq.codeplex.com/">DirectQ</a>: OGG<strong>**</strong>, MP3, WMA, WAV<br/></li></ul></p><p><strong>*</strong> I assume that QuakeSpasm only supports MP3 in its Windows version. If you know differently, let me know.<br/><strong>**</strong> For OGG support, DirectQ requires that you have also installed the <a href="http://xiph.org/dshow/">DirectShow filter for OGG</a>.</p><p>The engine will look for music files with basenames in a specific form: track02 for the file ripped from the second CD track (which is the first piece of soundtrack music), track03 for the third track, and so forth.  So if they are MP3 files they should be named track02.mp3, track03.mp3, etc.  Ogg Vorbis files should be named track02.ogg, track03.ogg, etc.  You get the picture.</p><p>Quake engines can handle different placements for these files, but one place that they all currently agree on is the &ldquo;music&rdquo; subfolder inside the appropriate game directory.  So music files for the original Quake soundtrack should be placed in the &ldquo;id1\music&rdquo; folder (which you will need to create).  Music files for the Mission Pack 1 soundtrack should go in &ldquo;hipnotic\music&rdquo;; music files for Mission Pack 2 in &ldquo;rogue\music&rdquo;.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-233460" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> If you have installed <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-hd-pack-guide">Quake HD</a> or the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923">&ldquo;Ultimate Quake Patch&rdquo;</a>, then you will get Ogg Vorbis files for the main campaign soundtrack placed in the &ldquo;id1\sound\cdtracks&rdquo; folder.  Also files in &ldquo;hipnotic\sound\cdtracks&rdquo; and &ldquo;rogue\sound\cdtracks&rdquo; for the mission pack soundtracks.<br/><br/>The DarkPlaces engine, which is included in these bundles, can find music files in &ldquo;sound\cdtracks&rdquo;, so that's fine.  If you want to also use these files with QuakeSpasm &ndash; which is the other engine that can handle Ogg Vorbis files &ndash; you need to move them to the appropriate &ldquo;music&rdquo; folder(s) instead: &ldquo;id1\music&rdquo;, &ldquo;hipnotic\music&rdquo;, and &ldquo;rogue\music&rdquo;.  DarkPlaces will still be able to find them there.<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-233460" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> If you downloaded the soundtrack files from the <a href="http://quakeone.com/forums/quake-mod-releases/finished-works/7337-high-quality-music-packs.html">quakeone.com forums</a>, they are packaged inside pk3 files (which are just zip archives). If you're using DarkPlaces then you can put the pk3 file for the Quake soundtrack inside the id1 folder and it will work; likewise the pk3 file for the mission pack soundtracks should be placed into the hipnotic and rogue folders respectively.<br/><br/>Each of these zipfiles contain Ogg Vorbis tracks.  If you were to extract the tracks from the zipfile you'd see that they're located in the &ldquo;sound\cdtracks&rdquo; path.  As mentioned above, DarkPlaces is OK with music files at that location.<br/><br/>If you want to also use these files with the QuakeSpasm engine, you need to extract them and move them to the appropriate &ldquo;music&rdquo; folder(s) instead: &ldquo;id1\music&rdquo;, &ldquo;hipnotic\music&rdquo;, and &ldquo;rogue\music&rdquo;.  DarkPlaces will still be able to find them there.<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-233460" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> If you have installed <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-epsilon-build">Quake Epsilon</a>, then you will have pk3 files (which are just zip archives) that include alternative soundtrack music for Quake and the mission packs: &ldquo;id1\quake1_music_diabolipak.pk3&rdquo;, &ldquo;hipnotic\baz-pakwerk_soundtrack_greenwoodaudiomastered.pk3&rdquo;, and &ldquo;rogue\sonic_mayhem-methods_of_destruction_mp2-xolveedit.pk3&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Each of these zipfiles contain Ogg Vorbis tracks.  If you were to extract the tracks from the zipfile you'd see that they're located in the &ldquo;sound\cdtracks&rdquo; path.  As mentioned above, DarkPlaces is OK with music files at that location.<br/><br/>You can delete those pk3 files if you want to disable or replace this alternative soundtrack.  On the other hand, if you like them enough to want to listen to them with the QuakeSpasm engine, you need to extract the music files and move the extracted files to the appropriate &ldquo;music&rdquo; folder(s): &ldquo;id1\music&rdquo;, &ldquo;hipnotic\music&rdquo;, and/or &ldquo;rogue\music&rdquo;.  DarkPlaces will still be able to find them there.<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/>As you can probably tell, it is much more common to find Quake soundtrack files in OGG format rather than in MP3 format, which means that they can only be played by the DarkPlaces or QuakeSpasm engines. If you have the OGG files but you want to listen to the soundtrack while playing with Fitzquake Mark V or DirectQ, you'll need to convert them to MP3 format (and make sure that the files are placed in the appropriate &ldquo;music&rdquo; subfolder). There are many many programs for doing that sort of conversion, so just head off to Google and find one.</p><h3>&bull; Engines that control external players</h3><p>If a Quake engine has a feature that allows it to control an external player application, it may be possible to play the soundtrack that way.  The tricky part is to get the right music to automatically play at the right times, rather than just running through a playlist or requiring manual input.</p><p>For the <a href="http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/">ezQuake</a> engine, Pirate-X posted a <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=27018156&amp;postcount=32">scripting solution for controlling Winamp</a> on the old Steam forums.</p><p><a href="http://fodquake.net/">Fodquake</a> and <a href="http://www.fteqw.com/">FTEQW</a> also include some amount of support for controlling an external Winamp process, but I'm not aware of how to script them for perfect soundtrack playback.</p>  <h2 id="04">Sample Rate</h2>
  <p>One potential &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; with playing soundtrack music files through Quake is the prospect of losing some of the higher frequencies in CD-quality audio, when Quake goes through the process of mixing and (possibly) downsampling the audio before outputting it.  Quake engines do provide some control over the output rate, but it's not completely clear (to me) exactly what such a setting does internally to achieve that output rate.  Also FYI the setting will affect all sound effects, not just the music.</p><p>The typical way to control the sound output's sample rate is with the &ldquo;-sndspeed&rdquo; command-line option.  Specifying &ldquo;-sndspeed 44100&rdquo; on the command line when launching a Quake engine is essentially asking for CD-quality output.</p><p>Command-line options can be passed to a Quake engine executable by various methods. See the &ldquo;Command Line&rdquo; section of this guide: <a href="owners_manual.html"><img src="../../images/guides/common/neo.png" class="linkBadge"></img> Quake Owner's Manual</a><br/><br/>Because of my uncertainty about the effects this has on the mixing process and other sound effects, and in what way any upsampling would be handled, I wouldn't say that you should always use this option.  Try it out if you want to hear the difference though.</p><p>In my experience on the Windows versions of these engines, just listening through headphones:</p><p><ul><li>DarkPlaces is outputting at 48 kHz by default.  It sounds fine to me without any sndspeed changes.<br/></li><li>QuakeSpasm is outputting at 11.025 kHz by default.  It sounds somewhat fuzzy to me.  Using &ldquo;-sndspeed 44100&rdquo; with QuakeSpasm does improve it for my tastes.<br/></li><li>FitzQuake Mark V also outputs at 11.025 kHz by default, as far as I know, but it sounds clearer than the QuakeSpasm default.  I can take or leave any sndspeed adjustment here.<br/></li><li>DirectQ mixes internally at CD quality.  It sounds fine to me without any sndspeed changes.<br/></li></ul></p><p><br/>This is completely a matter of taste.  If you're using one of the high-default-output-rate engines and are really attached to the original DOS Quake sound, you might even want to use &ldquo;-sndspeed 11025&rdquo; on the command line to try to re-create that.  It's also quite possible that playing this audio over a good set of speakers, rather than headphones, would lead to different decisions.</p>  <h2 id="05">Revision History 'n Stuff</h2>
