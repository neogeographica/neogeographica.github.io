  <h2 id="01">The Problem With CD Audio</h2>
  <p>As originally released, Quake played its soundtrack music using CD audio.  Each track was actually a track on the CD itself (starting with track 2; track 1 contained the game data).  The soundtrack music was never installed to your hard drive as a file.</p><p>The problem with that now is that if you get Quake through digital distribution, you don't get a CD.  So no music.</p><p>Of course, if you have an original Quake CD from back in the day, and it's still readable, then you might be good to go.  Or you might not be &ndash; the original Quake engines, and some (or all?) modern Quake engines, will not properly loop the music tracks when used in versions of Windows after Windows XP.  And there are plenty of other reasons you might not want to mess with a physical CD anyway.</p><p>Fortunately there are several ways to manage without a physical CD and still hear the good old creepy Quake music while you play.</p>  <h2 id="02">Soundtrack Files</h2>
  <p>For any of these solutions to work, you do first have to get either a Quake CD image or ripped music tracks from somewhere.  If you don't have a physical Quake CD then there are all sorts of ways to buy or borrow one, and likewise there are various ways to get a CD image or the ripped tracks.  For example:</p><p><ul><li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/2310/discussions/0/882966056497559791/">A thread on the Steam forums</a> provides download links for CD images of the music tracks, and also for ripped soundtrack files in OGG (Ogg Vorbis) format.<br/></li><li>The quakeone.com forums provide <a href="http://quakeone.com/forums/quake-mod-releases/finished-works/7337-high-quality-music-packs.html">soundtrack files in OGG format</a>.<br/></li><li>Quaddicted also provides <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/files/music/">soundtrack files in OGG format</a>.<br/></li></ul></p><p>And if you're using a bundle package of Quake stuff that has been assembled by someone else, it may already include a soundtrack:</p><p><ul><li>The <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-hd-pack-guide">Quake HD</a> bundle includes soundtrack files in OGG format, along with the DarkPlaces engine and a bunch of other new textures and sounds.<br/></li><li>The <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923">&ldquo;Ultimate Quake Patch&rdquo;</a> includes soundtrack files in OGG format, along with an older version of the DarkPlaces engine and a few other things.<br/></li><li>The <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-epsilon-build">Quake Epsilon</a> bundle also includes the DarkPlaces engine and OGG-format music, although in this case the music is a set of replacement/alternative selections rather than the original Quake soundtrack.<br/></li></ul></p><p>(And the sources above also provide soundtracks for the Quake mission packs.)</p><p>So before going any further in this guide you should have either soundtrack files, a physical CD, or a CD image. If you have soundtrack files you can skip to the next section (although you may also want to check out the &ldquo;More You Know&rdquo; box below).</p><p>If you have a CD image then you need some sort of virtual CD software to &ldquo;mount&rdquo; the image, so that applications see it as a real CD.  <a href="http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html">Virtual Clone Drive</a> is popular but there are lots of choices.</p><p>Now, you could just mount the CD image and then let Quake play music from it as if it were a physical CD.  But that approach is a bit of a hassle and it suffers from the same no-looping problem as real CDs.  So let's not do that!</p><p>Instead we're going to go with solutions that play music files from your hard disk, one file for each of the music tracks from the CD.  If you don't already have the Quake soundtrack in this form, then you should take either the physical CD or mounted CD image and rip the tracks from it into music files.  Once you have those files, you no longer need the CD or image.</p><p>The format that you rip to does matter, as the various solutions below support different music file formats.  Generally speaking though, OGG files are widely supported.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-233460" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> Audio buffs may want to take note that the music on the Quake CD is &ldquo;pre-emphasized&rdquo;.  The hydrogenaudio wiki has a <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Pre-emphasis">summary of pre-emphasis</a> that is worth a look.  The upshot is that to make the playback sound exactly correct, the ripped files need to have been processed with a specific equalization curve to get rid of the pre-emphasis.<br/><br/>Ripping a CD with iTunes will handle such &ldquo;de-emphasis&rdquo; automatically.  The hydrogenaudio wiki page has some tips about other ripping methods, and Google will also turn up good discussion about this.<br/><br/>The difference between Quake tracks that have been properly de-emphasized and those that haven't is fairly subtle to my old ears.  If you are in the mood to decode a spectral analysis, here's a comparison of a ripped file of the first Quake track not de-emphasized (top) vs. de-emphasized (bottom):<br/><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/track02-ogg.png" id="trigger-237579" class="guidePic sizeThumb inline" /><br/><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/track02-deemph-ogg.png" id="trigger-237578" class="guidePic sizeThumb inline" /><br/><br/>The general effect of de-emphasis is to have more of a contrast in volume between the low and high frequencies.<br/><br/>If you are using a soundtrack that you downloaded instead of ripping it yourself, and you don't know whether or not the tracks have been de-emphasized&#8230; well, they probably haven't been, but you might not want to lose sleep over it.  Just something to keep in mind. If you want to test it, you can get the free <a href="http://spek.cc/">Spek</a> tool, use it to open up your track02.ogg or track02.mp3 file, and compare the image you get to the images above.<br/><br/>The music files included in <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-hd-pack-guide">Quake HD</a> and in the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923">&ldquo;Ultimate Quake Patch&rdquo;</a> have <em>not</em> been de-emphasized. I haven't checked the other sources mentioned above.</blockquote></p>  <h2 id="03">Playing the Soundtrack</h2>
  <p>There are multiple approaches to using Quake soundtrack files.  What's the right one for you?  It depends on which Quake engine you are using.  If that sentence confuses you, then have a look at this guide: <a href="engines.html"><img src="../../images/guides/common/neo.png" class="linkBadge"></img> Quake Engines, Old and New</a><br/><br/></p><h3>&bull; Engines that don't have soundtrack support</h3><p>The ProQuake engine as of version 4.91beta no longer supports any kind of soundtrack playback, not even CD audio.</p><p>Engoo does not officially support CD audio (although it might work for you). It can play MIDI files but that doesn't help with playing the soundtrack.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Engines that only support CD audio</h3><p>The original Quake engines (the ones provided by Steam) only support CD audio.  If you want to get them to play music files instead, then you will have to modify them.  I haven't tried this myself, but Dragonsbrethren has posted a guide: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113399618"><img src="../../images/guides/common/steam.png" class="linkBadge"></img> How to fix CD audio looping on Windows Vista/7</a><br/><br/>Most modern Quake engines also still support CD audio, so there is a good chance that this modification would also work on them.  However if an engine can manage one of the other solutions below, then it would probably be better to use that other solution.  It's nicer not to need to binary-patch your Quake executable.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Engines that play soundtrack music files</h3><p>Some modern Quake engines can play music files to give you a soundtrack during the game. Among the choices listed in the &ldquo;Quake Engines&rdquo; guide, soundtrack file playback is supported by <a href="http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/">DarkPlaces</a>, <a href="http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/">QuakeSpasm</a>, <a href="http://celephais.net/board/view_thread.php?id=60831">FitzQuake Mark V</a>, <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/files/engines/directq/DirectQ%201.9.0%20Executable.zip">DirectQ</a>, and <a href="http://super8.qbism.com/">qbism Super8</a>.</p><p>For soundtrack file playback to work, a few things have to be handled correctly:</p><p><ul><li>whether the music files are &ldquo;loose files&rdquo;, or inside pak/pk3 archives<br/></li><li>where the files are placed<br/></li><li>what the files are named<br/></li><li>what audio format the files are in<br/></li></ul></p><p><br/>Different Quake engines support different answers for those questions. However the first three questions have a common set of answers that will work for all engines mentioned above.</p><p>If you already have a setup that works for the engine you're currently using, I'm not saying you should change it. This is just a description of a common arrangement that works for multiple engines:</p><p><ul><li>The music files are loose files, <strong>NOT</strong> inside a pak or pk3 archive.<br/></li></ul></p><p><ul><li>The files are placed inside a &ldquo;music&rdquo; subfolder of the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder. For missionpack or mod soundtracks, the files are placed in a &ldquo;music&rdquo; subfolder of the appropriate game folder. So the original Quake soundtrack files go inside &ldquo;id1\music&rdquo;, Mission Pack 1 soundtrack files go inside &ldquo;hipnotic\music&rdquo;, and Mission Pack 2 soundtrack files go inside &ldquo;rogue\music&rdquo;.<br/></li></ul></p><p><ul><li>The files are named in the pattern "track<em>nn</em>&ldquo;, where &rdquo;<em>nn</em>&ldquo; is the CD track number that the file was ripped from. Since the soundtrack starts at the second CD track, MP3 soundtrack files are named &rdquo;track02.mp3&ldquo;, &rdquo;track03.mp3&ldquo;, etc. OGG soundtrack files are named &rdquo;track02.ogg&ldquo;, &rdquo;track03.ogg", etc.<br/></li></ul></p><p>As for the audio format: most of the distributions of the Quake soundtrack are in OGG format, and OGG files can be played by most of these Quake engines. Specifically, the five Quake engines discussed here support the following formats:</p><p><ul><li>DarkPlaces: OGG, WAV<br/></li><li>QuakeSpasm: OGG, MP3, WAV<br/></li><li>FitzQuake Mark V: MP3<br/></li><li>DirectQ: OGG, MP3, WMA, WAV<br/></li><li>qbism Super8: OGG, MP3<br/></li></ul></p><p>The Windows or OS X version of a Quake engine will inherently support the sound formats listed above for that engine. One exception is DirectQ, which for OGG support requires that you also install the <a href="http://xiph.org/dshow/">DirectShow filter for OGG</a>.</p><p>The Linux version of QuakeSpasm requires external libraries: libogg or libvorbis for OGG support, and libmad or libmpg123 for MP3. I'm not sure if DarkPlaces' OGG support on Linux has the same requirement, but I suspect it does.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-233460" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> If you have installed <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-hd-pack-guide">Quake HD</a> or the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923">&ldquo;Ultimate Quake Patch&rdquo;</a>, then you got OGG files for the main campaign soundtrack placed in the &ldquo;id1\sound\cdtracks&rdquo; folder.  Also files in &ldquo;hipnotic\sound\cdtracks&rdquo; and &ldquo;rogue\sound\cdtracks&rdquo; for the mission pack soundtracks.<br/><br/>The DarkPlaces engine, which is included in these bundles, can find music files in &ldquo;sound\cdtracks&rdquo;, so that's fine.  If you want to also use these files with QuakeSpasm or DirectQ &ndash; the other engines that can handle OGG files &ndash; you need to move them to the appropriate &ldquo;music&rdquo; folder(s) instead: &ldquo;id1\music&rdquo;, &ldquo;hipnotic\music&rdquo;, and &ldquo;rogue\music&rdquo;.  DarkPlaces will still be able to find them there.<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-233460" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> If you downloaded the soundtrack files from the <a href="http://quakeone.com/forums/quake-mod-releases/finished-works/7337-high-quality-music-packs.html">quakeone.com forums</a>, they are packaged inside pk3 files (which are just zip archives). If you're using DarkPlaces then you can put the pk3 file for the Quake soundtrack inside the id1 folder and it will work; likewise the pk3 file for the mission pack soundtracks should be placed into the hipnotic and rogue folders respectively.<br/><br/>Each of these zipfiles contain OGG tracks.  If you were to extract the tracks from the zipfile you'd see that they're located in the &ldquo;sound\cdtracks&rdquo; path.  As mentioned above, DarkPlaces is OK with music files at that location.<br/><br/>If you want to also use these files with the QuakeSpasm or DirectQ engines, you need to extract them and move them to the appropriate &ldquo;music&rdquo; folder(s) instead: &ldquo;id1\music&rdquo;, &ldquo;hipnotic\music&rdquo;, and &ldquo;rogue\music&rdquo;.  DarkPlaces will still be able to find them there.<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/soundtrack_solutions/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-233460" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> If you have installed <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-epsilon-build">Quake Epsilon</a>, then you will have pk3 files (which are just zip archives) that include alternative soundtrack music for Quake and the mission packs: &ldquo;id1\quake1_music_diabolipak.pk3&rdquo;, &ldquo;hipnotic\baz-pakwerk_soundtrack_greenwoodaudiomastered.pk3&rdquo;, and &ldquo;rogue\sonic_mayhem-methods_of_destruction_mp2-xolveedit.pk3&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Each of these zipfiles contain OGG tracks.  If you were to extract the tracks from the zipfile you'd see that they're located in the &ldquo;sound\cdtracks&rdquo; path.  As mentioned above, DarkPlaces is OK with music files at that location.<br/><br/>You can delete those pk3 files if you want to remove this alternative soundtrack.  On the other hand, if you like it enough to want to listen to it with the QuakeSpasm or DirectQ engines, you need to extract the music files and move the extracted files to the appropriate &ldquo;music&rdquo; folder(s): &ldquo;id1\music&rdquo;, &ldquo;hipnotic\music&rdquo;, and/or &ldquo;rogue\music&rdquo;.  DarkPlaces will still be able to find them there.<br/></blockquote></p><h3>&bull; Engines that control external players</h3><p>If a Quake engine has a feature that allows it to control an external player application, it may be possible to play the soundtrack that way.  The tricky part is to get the right music to automatically play at the right times.</p><p>For the <a href="http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/">ezQuake</a> engine, Pirate-X posted a <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=27018156&amp;postcount=32">scripting solution for controlling Winamp</a> on the old Steam forums.</p><p><a href="http://fodquake.net/">Fodquake</a> and <a href="http://www.fteqw.com/">FTEQW</a> include support for controlling an external Winamp process, but I'm not aware of how to script them for soundtrack play.</p>  <h2 id="04">Sample Rate</h2>
  <p>First a bit of history:</p><p>The Quake sound effects come from WAV files with a sample rate of 11025 Hz, and that was the quality/rate at which they were played. However some sound cards at the time were picky about the sample rate that they would accept, and so the original Quake engines introduced a command-line option (&ldquo;-sspeed&rdquo; and then later &ldquo;-sndspeed&rdquo;) that could be used to change the output rate for the sound effects.</p><p>Setting &ldquo;-sndspeed 44100&rdquo; for example &ndash; to represent a 44100 Hz output sample rate &ndash; might have been necessary to get some sound card to work, but it did not actually improve the quality of the sounds. It did change the tone of the sounds, as a result of the upsampling, making effects sound &ldquo;brighter&rdquo;. Although this changed the character of the original sounds, some players preferred or at least got accustomed to a higher sndspeed setting.</p><p>Command-line options can be passed to a Quake engine executable by various methods. See the &ldquo;Command Line&rdquo; section of this guide: <a href="owners_manual.html"><img src="../../images/guides/common/neo.png" class="linkBadge"></img> Quake Owner's Manual</a><br/><br/>The soundtrack music is of higher quality than the sound effects: &ldquo;CD quality&rdquo;, 44100 Hz. In the original Quake, the soundtrack music was played back through a separate system than the sound effects, and the &ldquo;-sndspeed&rdquo; command-line option did not affect the music.</p><p>When Quake engines first added support for playing soundtrack music files, the &ldquo;-sndspeed&rdquo; option <strong>did</strong> affect that music playback, at least in some cases. If you preferred the original character of the Quake sound effects, that could mean that you were stuck with muffled/fuzzy-sounding music. Fortunately, you don't have to make that choice these days; if you're using the latest version of one of the engines described here, the music playback should again be handled independently of the sound effect sample rate. (Particularly, if you're using the QuakeSpasm engine, make sure that you're at version 0.85.10 or later.)</p><p>So you should always have CD-quality soundtrack music playback now. If you were previously using the &ldquo;-sndspeed&rdquo; option just to improve the music, you should reconsider that.</p><p>As for the sound effects, here's a summary of how sndspeed settings behave for each of these engines.</p><p><ul><li>DarkPlaces defaults to a sndspeed of 48000, but it plays sound effects similarly to the original Quake; they don't sound brighter to my ears. I would guess that its sndspeed value is the sample rate for its final mix, but I can't actually detect any change to the sound effects or music if I specify different sndspeed values.<br/></li></ul></p><p><ul><li>QuakeSpasm defaults to a sndspeed of 11025. At that sndspeed, it also provides a new console variable &ldquo;snd_filterquality&rdquo; that more exactly controls how the sound effects are played; see its README for more details. If you prefer the brighter sound effects, you can use &ldquo;-sndspeed 44100&rdquo;.<br/></li></ul></p><p><ul><li>FitzQuake Mark V and DirectQ default to a sndspeed of 11025. If you prefer the brighter sound effects, you can use &ldquo;-sndspeed 44100&rdquo;.<br/></li></ul></p><p><ul><li>qbism Super8, like DarkPlaces, defaults to a sndspeed of 48000. Also like DarkPlaces, I don't hear a difference when using different sndspeed values. Unlike DarkPlaces, the sound effects in qbism Super8 have the brighter, upsampled tone.<br/></li></ul></p><p><br/>Most of these engines also provide a console variable for the sndspeed setting, either named &ldquo;sndspeed&rdquo; or &ldquo;snd_speed&rdquo;, which may or may not be saved to the config file; check the engine's README or other docs.</p>  <h2 id="05">Revision History 'n Stuff</h2>
