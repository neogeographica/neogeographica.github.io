  <h2 id="01">What to Read</h2>
  <p>Forum questions about Quake configuration have covered a lot of different ground in the past, so there's a lot of different topics to cover.</p><p>If you're not familiar with the available varieties of Quake engines &ndash; or even what &ldquo;Quake engines&rdquo; means &ndash; then you might want to take a look at this other guide first: <a href="engines.html"><img src="../../images/guides/common/neo.png" class="linkBadge"></img> Quake Engines, Old and New</a><br/><br/>When you see a reference to ezQuake, FTEQW, Fodquake, DarkPlaces, QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, DirectQ, ProQuake, or Qrack&#8230; all those odd words are names of other programs that can be used to play Quake.  Read the Quake Engines guide if you want to learn more about them.</p><p>As for <em>this</em> guide, we lead off with a necessary warning about Windows issues and then go straight to a quickstart&#8230; an efficient way to start Quaking.  If you're new to Quake then you should probably just follow the quickstart, and come back to the rest of the guide later as a reference if you have problems.</p><p>The next few sections get into general descriptions of how the Quake menus, config file, console, and command line work.  If you're familiar with those ideas then you could skim or skip those sections.</p><p>The middle sections, from &ldquo;Mouselook&rdquo; through &ldquo;Limits&rdquo;, describe how to deal with some of the more fundamental bits of Quake configuration that aren't always easily handled through the menus.</p><p>The sections near the end contain cut-and-paste-able examples of command lines and config files for each Quake engine.  But keep in mind that these examples are tuned specifically for my own tastes.  You may want to do something different!</p><p>Finally the &ldquo;More Info&rdquo; section is a link dump in case you're not tired of reading about Quake.</p>  <h2 id="02">Special Folders in Windows</h2>
  <p>In versions of Windows after Windows XP, some folders like &ldquo;Program Files&rdquo; and &ldquo;Program Files (x86)&rdquo; are treated specially.  The contents of these folders have some protection against files being written inside them (or inside their subfolders).</p><p>Some older programs won't work if installed under these special folders.  Some other programs work but have changed behavior.</p><p>Personally I don't install games under these folders, especially not old games.  My Steam installation is under &ldquo;C:\Games&rdquo;, for example.</p><p>So the rest of the information in this guide was observed and tested with Quake installations outside of those special folders.  If you have your Quake installation under a special folder, it might be perfectly fine.  But I can't guarantee that it will behave the same way as mine.</p>  <h2 id="03">Quick Start</h2>
  <p>If you want to jump right in and start Quaking with minimum effort, this section is for you.</p><p>First you should get a modern Quake engine.  The basic idea is that you will download a new Quake executable.  There may be some other files or folders along with it, but at a minimum you're getting a program that you will run to play Quake.</p><p>When you run this program, it will look for an &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder in some location. Usually, at least on Windows systems, it will expect the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder to be placed right next to the Quake engine program.  (But consult the docs for your Quake engine if you want to be sure.)  So create the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder if it doesn't yet exist.</p><p>Quake requires two files inside the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder: &ldquo;pak0.pak&rdquo; and &ldquo;pak1.pak&rdquo;. You can get those two pak files from your Steam copy of Quake, or any other Quake installation. Once you have moved or copied those files into your &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder you can start playing.</p><p>Below are my recommendations for popular, full-featured, menu-driven modern Quake engines that require a minimum of unintuitive tomfoolery to configure.  There are other fine choices though!  I don't want to start a holy war, just to give folks a quick way to get started.  Please read the Quake Engines guide if you want the complete picture.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Multiplayer</h3><p>The <a href="http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/">ezQuake</a> engine is a good choice.</p><p>(Note that the non-Windows versions of ezQuake are not as well maintained as the Windows version.  If you intend to Quake on OS X or Linux, then you will probably need to check the Quake Engines guide to find some other engine that fits your needs.)</p><p>If you want to get ezQuake along with a collection of new textures, HUDs, etc. then you can use the <a href="http://www.nquake.com/">nQuake</a> package. See the ezQuake section of the Quake Engines guide for more details.</p><p>When you're using ezQuake you can set up just about everything through the menus.  It's probably worth taking a look at the &ldquo;Widescreen&rdquo; section later in this guide if you want to get everything just right though.</p><p>Although it's primarily for multiplayer, ezQuake can also play the original Quake campaign.  But for singleplayer beyond that &ndash; mods, mission packs, many recent custom maps &ndash;  you'll want to use some other engine, which brings us to:<br/></p><h3>&bull; Singleplayer</h3><p>Unfortunately I have to to waffle a bit here.</p><p>First let me say that for maximum ease of use the pick should be <a href="http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/">DarkPlaces</a>.</p><p>Check the DarkPlaces section of the QuakeEngines guide for a little more info about some installers and bundles you might be interested in. (If you want to get DarkPlaces along with a <em>large</em> collection of new media then I recommend <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-hd-pack-guide">Quake HD</a>.)</p><p>DarkPlaces has good in-game menus, but again I would recommend at least taking a look at the &ldquo;Widescreen&rdquo; section below in order to finish up your configuration.</p><p>OK that aside&#8230; inconveniently for DarkPlaces fans, some custom maps are not really tested against DarkPlaces.  If you want to make sure that you can play recent map releases, especially the more experimental stuff, then you will probably want to use <a href="http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/">QuakeSpasm</a>, and you'll benefit from digging into this guide a bit more.  QuakeSpasm (or some other &ldquo;faithful graphics&rdquo; engine like DirectQ or Fitzquake Mark V) is also a better choice than DarkPlaces if you prefer your Quake graphics oldschool.</p><p>If you're playing on Windows, you may want to use the <a href="http://quakeone.com/proquake/Quakespasm_Steam_Easy_Install.exe">QuakeSpasm installer for Steam Quake owners</a>.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Go forth and Quake</h3><p>That's it, quickstart done!  You can just treat the rest of this guide as a reference for when you have problems or want to learn more.  It will be especially useful for some of the other Quake engines, and double-especially if you are trying to get the original Quake engines to behave.</p>  <h2 id="04">GLQuake Version Issues</h2>
  <p>The version of GLQuake distributed with Steam (0.95) is not the latest version for some reason, and it is a bit crashy. It also does not understand some of the options described in the &ldquo;Widescreen&rdquo; section of this guide.</p><p>You can get a more recent version of GLQuake (0.97) from the official id software FTP site and elsewhere. This version is better, but still doesn't support FOV changes.</p><p><ul><li>Windows: ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/unsup/glq1114.exe<br/></li><li>Linux: ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/unsup/unix/glquake-0.97-i386-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz<br/></li></ul></p><p>(Steam guides don't support FTP links, sorry&#8230; cut and paste into your browser address bar.)</p><p>Version 0.98 of GLQuake adds FOV support.  It was never officially released, but the Windows version has been available around the web and used by Quake players since way back in the 20th century. So if you want an OpenGL renderer and don't want to use a modern Quake engine &ndash; and you are using Windows &ndash; then GLQuake 0.98 is the version I'd recommend. One link that is still working: <a href="http://www.quaketerminus.com/nqexes/glquake098alpha.zip">http://www.quaketerminus.com/nqexes/glquake098alpha.zip</a></p><p>When you're installing any downloaded version of id's original GLQuake engine, do <em>not </em> enable any installer option that mentions a &ldquo;3Dfx GL miniport&rdquo;. Similarly, discard any library file (like &ldquo;opengl32.dll&rdquo;) that comes with the download.  Those things are only useful if you're rocking a 3Dfx Voodoo graphics card from 1996.  These days, all you need is the GLQuake executable.  (I'm only speaking from experience with the Windows version; not sure about the Linux version.)</p><p>But you really should just use a modern Quake engine instead and avoid these worries altogether!<br/></p>  <h2 id="05">In-Game Menu</h2>
  <p>Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way first.  Explore the options menu!  If you don't see a way to get to the options menu, try pressing ESC.  The pictures below are an example of the rather simple menu in GLQuake and the comprehensive multi-section menu of the ezQuake engine:<br/><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/quakeoptions.jpg" id="trigger-237190" class="guidePic sizeThumb floatLeft" /> <img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/ezquakeoptions.jpg" id="trigger-237189" class="guidePic sizeThumb floatRight" /></p><p>At a minimum you want to enable the &ldquo;Always Run&rdquo; option, and you may also want to &ldquo;Invert Mouse&rdquo; if you swing that way.  Set up your movement keys, etc.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-236895" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> Unlike other Quake engines, the Qrack engine doesn't have any keys bound by default, if you start it up in a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; install.  When you first run Qrack it will try to import any existing Quake settings, including key bindings.  If it can't do this import then you'll have more work than usual to do in the menus.<br/><br/>(Specifically, it attempts to import settings from the &ldquo;config.cfg&rdquo; file in the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder; see the section below about &ldquo;The Config File&rdquo;.)<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/>Modern Quake engines can have a ton of menu options.  It can be a little intimidating, since some of the mega-menus are obviously aimed at people who are already familiar with Quake, but it's worth looking through everything.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-236895" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> Most Quake engines will automatically save any options changes that you make.  But ezQuake, FTEQW, and Fodquake do not.  In those engines, any changes that you make using the menus will be discarded when you quit Quake unless you explicitly save your changes.  Look for a menu item labelled &ldquo;Save Settings&rdquo; or &ldquo;Save Configuration&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In ezQuake you can also enable an option to &ldquo;Auto Save on Quit&rdquo; which makes it unnecessary to explicitly save your settings.  At first it might seem like a no-brainer to turn this on.  But it can be nice to be able to freely experiment with settings, while knowing that if you totally screw things up you can just quit the game and everything will revert.<br/><br/>Quick update: looks like if you set things up using the latest version of the <a href="http://www.nquake.com/">nQuake package</a>, then ezQuake will have &ldquo;Auto Save on Quit&rdquo; enabled by default.<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/>You'll almost certainly want to adjust settings beyond those provided in the in-game menus, so that's what the rest of the guide will be about.  Before we get to talking about those specific settings, we'll first cover <em>how</em> you can really get under the hood to reach them.</p>  <h2 id="06">The Config File</h2>
  <h3>&bull; Basic Configuration</h3><p>Changes that you make using the in-game menu, and some other changes that we'll get to in a minute, are stored in a file.</p><p>The name and location of this file depends on which Quake engine you are using.  The Quake Engines guide (linked at the top of this guide) covers this, but if you're in too much of a hurry for that, then here's the short form:</p><p><ul><li>If you run &ldquo;Quake&rdquo; or &ldquo;GLQuake&rdquo; from Steam, configuration will be stored in a file named &ldquo;config.cfg&rdquo; in the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder of your Quake installation.<br/></li></ul></p><p><ul><li>If you run &ldquo;QuakeWorld&rdquo; or &ldquo;GLQuakeWorld&rdquo; from Steam, configuration will be stored in a file named &ldquo;config.cfg&rdquo; in the &ldquo;qw&rdquo; folder of your Quake installation.<br/></li></ul></p><p>Steam will normally install Quake in the &ldquo;steamapps\common\quake&rdquo; folder under your Steam folder.</p><p>Modern Quake engines may have different ideas about where to store their configuration, and if you want more specifics about that then you'll have to hop over to the &ldquo;Engine Coexistence&rdquo; section of the Quake Engines guide.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Missionpacks and Mods</h3><p>Playing a mod or missionpack can have an effect on how your configuration is stored.</p><p>A mod or missionpack consists of additional files that are placed in their own subfolder, parallel to &ldquo;id1&rdquo; and &ldquo;qw&rdquo;.  When you want to play the mod/missionpack in singleplayer, you use the &ldquo;-game&rdquo; command-line option to select that folder, according to the instructions in the mod's readme file.  (Command-line options are covered in another section below.) negke's guide to custom maps/mods discusses that: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=166554615"><img src="../../images/guides/common/steam.png" class="linkBadge"></img> Custom Singleplayer Levels</a><br/><br/>But just as a quick example, if you have a mod stored in the &ldquo;travail&rdquo; folder, then to activate it, one of your command-line options would need to be<br/><div class="code"><pre>-game travail</pre></div></p><p><br/>We'll ignore QuakeWorld, GLQuakeWorld, and Fodquake for this section; those engines don't support singleplayer.</p><p>For ezQuake and FTEQW, the &ldquo;-game&rdquo; option doesn't affect the config file &ndash; possibly because even though these engines have some singleplayer support, they are primarily aimed at QuakeWorld multiplayer.</p><p>For all other Quake engines though, when you use the &ldquo;-game&rdquo; option to specify a folder, your configuration will be stored in that folder.  If no config file exists there, then it will first be copied over from its original location (which is usually in the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder, or the &ldquo;qrack&rdquo; folder in the case of the Qrack engine).  So when you first start up a mod, you should see your familiar configuration.</p><p>While running a mod, you may want to make changes specific to that mod, such as binding a key to a new weapon.  Any changes you make to your configuration while using a particular &ldquo;-game&rdquo; folder will only affect the config file in that folder.</p>  <h2 id="07">The Console</h2>
  <h3>&bull; Opening the console</h3><p>By using the Quake console &ndash; which is essentially just a large box for text entry and message display &ndash; you can check and change the values of console variables.  Think of console variables as &ldquo;settings&rdquo;; in fact many of them are directly used for storing settings that you choose from the in-game menus, such as sound volume or the name of your multiplayer character.</p><p>The console also allows you to execute some commands.  A command isn't necessarily setting a value that you can read back, but it does something to change the state of the game.  One of the simpler commands, for example, is &ldquo;quit&rdquo; to exit the game.</p><p>(Note that lots of documents will just use the term &ldquo;console commands&rdquo; to refer to both the variables and the commands.)</p><p>How you access the console depends on the current state of the game.  Some modern Quake engines will dump you directly into the console when they start up, and you have to press ESC to get the main menu.  Or vice-versa.  Most of the time however you will be seeing the &ldquo;attract reel&rdquo; demo on startup, or playing a game, or maybe watching a game recording.  In these situations you have to press the &ldquo;console key&rdquo; to open the console.  (And press the same key to close it again.)</p><p>The console key is on the upper left of your keyboard.  On US keyboards this is the key that has the backtick &ldquo;`&rdquo; and tilde &ldquo;~&rdquo; characters on it.  On some international keyboards it may be the caret &ldquo;^&rdquo; key.  In any case it should be that key in the upper left, below the ESC key and left of the number keys.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-236895" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> If you are using the Qrack engine, you don't have a &ldquo;console key&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Instead, if you want to get to the console when you are in-game with the Qrack engine, you will need to press ESC to get the main menu, choose &ldquo;Options&rdquo;, then choose &ldquo;Go To Console&rdquo;.  Once you're done, press ESC to close the console.<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/>The image below shows an open console while the &ldquo;attract reel&rdquo; is running in GLQuake.  The prompt and cursor at the bottom of the box is where you can type in settings and commands; the rest of the box shows a history of messages from the engine, and of what you have typed (in this image, nothing yet).</p><p><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/console.jpg" id="trigger-237201" class="guidePic sizeFull inline" /></p><h3>&bull; Why use the console?</h3><p>For one thing, it may be faster to use the console to enter commands or change settings, compared to using the graphical menus.  If for example you're in the middle of a game and you want to fiddle with the sound volume, one way to do this is of course to press ESC to bring up the menu, navigate to the options menu, find the volume setting and drag the slider.  But alternatively you could use the console.  Open the console, type<br/><div class="code"><pre>volume</pre></div></p><p>and press Enter.  (Note that you could actually just type &ldquo;vol&rdquo; and press Tab, rather than typing out &ldquo;volume&rdquo;, because the console supports tab-completion.)  This will ask Quake to show you the current value of that variable.  For example you might see this message in response:<br/><div class="code"><pre>"volume" is "0.7"</pre></div></p><p>If you want to change the value, you could type something like<br/><div class="code"><pre>volume 0.4</pre></div></p><p>and press Enter.  Then close the console and continue playing.</p><p>More importantly many of the commands and console variables are just not available at all through the graphical menus, especially in older Quake engines.  For example you can use the &ldquo;map&rdquo; command to load a different map in singleplayer, or &ldquo;changelevel&rdquo; to switch to a different level while preserving your current inventory.  Are you in the middle of e1m1 and you'd rather skip straight ahead to e1m2?  Open the console, type<br/><div class="code"><pre>changelevel e1m2</pre></div></p><p>and press Enter.  There you go.</p><p>The available console variables and commands differ between Quake engines, but many of the most important ones are the same.  For modern engines, the final authority is the documentation that you downloaded with the engine or that is online at the engine's website.  For the original Quake engines you can dig up the necessary info by searching the web for Quake console information (and almost all of that will still apply to modern engines).</p><p>As an example of some of that original documentation, see the &ldquo;Console Commands&rdquo; section of the <a href="http://www.inside3d.com/qip/home.shtml">Quake Info Pool</a>, or the &ldquo;Console Commands List&rdquo; section of this <a href="http://www.quakewiki.net/archives/console/commands/quake.html">archived info from PlanetQuake</a>.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Console vs. menu</h3><p>In the cases where a console variable is just storing the setting for some menu option, it doesn't matter whether you change it through the console or through the menu.  The results are the same.</p><p>Most of the settings covered in this guide are described in terms of console variables.  Some of the modern Quake engines &ndash; the ones with really extensive menus &ndash; will have menu options that handle some of these settings too.  To keep things as straightforward as possible, for now I'm just going to cover the console variables.  (I might add notes about the menu options in various engines later, if I can think of a way to do that without making this guide longer and messier.)</p><p>The bottom line is that if you come across a menu option that has the same effect as one of these console variables, feel free to use it.</p>  <h2 id="08">Saving Console Changes</h2>
  <h3>&bull; Saved or not?</h3><p>Some of the settings changes that you make through the console will be saved to the config file, so that they will still be in force the next time you run Quake.  Generally speaking any variable that corresponds to some menu setting will be saved.  But other variables might not be.</p><p>In this guide I'll try to be clear about which will be saved and which won't; but if you're ever unsure then it's easy enough just to check &ndash; restart Quake and use the console to check the value of that variable.  Or quit Quake and use a text editor to search for the name of that variable in your config file.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, modern QuakeWorld engines (ezQuake, Fodquake, FTEQW) should save every setting in the config file.  (<strong>They may not save automatically though!</strong>  See the info box in the &ldquo;In-Game Menu&rdquo; section for details.)</p><p>With other Quake engines, some of your preferred settings may not get saved to your config file.<br/></p><h3>&bull; autoexec.cfg</h3><p>You can take those unsaved settings, put them in a new file (one on each line of the file), and place that file inside one of the game data folders that Quake sees &ndash; usually the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder is a good choice.  The &ldquo;exec&rdquo; console command or the &ldquo;+exec&rdquo; command-line option will cause Quake to &ldquo;execute&rdquo; that file: to treat it as if each line was typed into the console.  For example this console command will execute a file named &ldquo;mysettings.cfg&rdquo;:<br/><div class="code"><pre>exec mysettings.cfg</pre></div></p><p><br/>Most Quake engines also have a handy feature that will save you the trouble of using the &ldquo;exec&rdquo; command.  If there is a file named &ldquo;autoexec.cfg&rdquo;, Quake will automatically execute that file on startup.  So the usual way to deal with settings not saved in the config file is to put them into an autoexec.cfg file.</p><p>Once settings are in autoexec.cfg you can stop worrying about them; they will be automatically applied when Quake starts.  If you ever want to change any of those settings, edit the autoexec.cfg file.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-236895" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> The FTEQW and Fodquake engines differ from other engines in that they do <em>not</em> automatically execute autoexec.cfg on startup (at least in their Windows versions).  However, since they save every useful console setting to the config file, in simple Quake setups there's not much need for autoexec.cfg with those engines.<br/><br/>If you do want FTEQW or Fodquake to use autoexec.cfg &ndash; for example when playing a mod that has an autoexec.cfg file &ndash; then you can use the &ldquo;+exec&rdquo; command-line option like so:<br/><div class="code"><pre>+exec autoexec.cfg</pre></div><br/>See the section on &ldquo;The Command Line&rdquo; below if you're not familiar with using command-line options.<br/></blockquote></p><p><br/>So to sum up what we've got so far: modern QuakeWorld engines generally stash every setting in the config file.  Other engines don't, but you can get around that using autoexec.cfg.  That's sort of straightforward, but there's one major &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; with autoexec.cfg: precedence.<br/></p><h3>&bull; File precedence</h3><p>Quake can look for files in a lot of places, and so it could end up finding multiple autoexec.cfg files.  When this happens it will only execute <em>one</em> autoexec.cfg file: the last one it finds.  It will &ldquo;forget&rdquo; about the others.</p><p>If you have an autoexec.cfg file that is mysteriously not being used, probably the reason is that Quake found some other autoexec.cfg file to use instead.</p><p>If you have a simple Quake setup this is not going to be an issue, but if you start playing around with mods or juggling multiple configurations then it can bite you.</p><p>The rules are:</p><p><ul><li>Quake will look in &ldquo;id1&rdquo; first, then look in the &ldquo;qw&rdquo; folder if it is a QuakeWorld engine, then finally look in the folder indicated by the &ldquo;-game&rdquo; command-line option (if any).<br/></li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li>Within a given folder, Quake will look at loose/unpackaged files and then look inside &ldquo;.pak&rdquo; files (and &ldquo;.pk3&rdquo; files if the engine supports that).<br/></li></ul></p><p></p><p><ul><li>&ldquo;.pak&rdquo; or &ldquo;.pk3&rdquo; files are examined in alphabetical order.<br/></li></ul></p><p><br/>As an example of how this can surprise you: if you use the <a href="http://www.nquake.com/">nQuake package</a>, you may not realize that it sets up a configuration using an autoexec.cfg file inside &ldquo;nquake.pk3&rdquo; in the &ldquo;qw&rdquo; folder.  When you run a QuakeWorld engine while the nQuake content is present, any loose autoexec.cfg file in &ldquo;id1&rdquo; or &ldquo;qw&rdquo; is going to be ignored in favor of the autoexec.cfg that is inside &ldquo;nquake.pk3&rdquo;.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Special note for ezQuake</h3><p>ezQuake provides a menu option called &ldquo;Save Unchanged Options&rdquo;.  If this is disabled, then only variables that differ from their defaults will be saved to your config file.</p><p>While it might seem like you should disable this to tidy up your config file, it's probably best to have it enabled.  Confusing stuff can happen otherwise.</p><p>For example, nQuake includes an extensive configuration that is loaded when you start up ezQuake (by virtue of the nQuake autoexec.cfg described above).  If you want to change any of these options back to their default values in your own config, then you <em>must</em> have &ldquo;Save Unchanged Options&rdquo; enabled.  Yeah it's a little counterintuitive.</p>  <h2 id="09">The Command Line</h2>
  <h3>&bull; Command-line options</h3><p>You may know that you can manually start Quake from some command shell in your operating system.  For example on Windows you could open a command shell using the Command Prompt program, type commands into that shell to navigate to your Quake folder, and then enter<br/><div class="code"><pre>GLquake.exe</pre></div></p><p>to start up Quake (in this case, the GLQuake engine).</p><p>It's possible to put more things after the program name in order to control its behavior; these things are called command-line options.  Several kinds of behavior can only be forced using command-line options, rather than with console variables or config files.  This is especially true for the original Quake engines.</p><p>If for example you want to make sure that Quake doesn't try to play music from the current CD in the drive, you can disable CD audio with a command-line option:<br/><div class="code"><pre>GLquake.exe -nocdaudio</pre></div></p><p>You can specify as many command-line options as you like, as long as you separate them with spaces.</p><p>Of course usually you don't start Quake by manually typing in a command shell.  Instead you usually launch it by clicking an icon or some other sort of UI action.  In these cases it might not be obvious how to send command-line options to the engine, but it's still possible as described in the sections below.</p><p>The available command-line options differ between Quake engines, but many of the most important ones are the same.  For modern engines, the final authority is the documentation that you downloaded with the engine or that is online at the engine's website.  For the original Quake engines you can dig up the necessary info by searching the web for Quake command line information (and much of that will still apply to modern engines).</p><p>As an example of some of that original documentation, see the &ldquo;Startup Commands&rdquo; section of the <a href="http://www.inside3d.com/qip/home.shtml">Quake Info Pool</a>, or the &ldquo;Command Line Parameters&rdquo; section of this <a href="http://www.quakewiki.net/archives/console/commands/quake.html">archived info from PlanetQuake</a>.</p><p>You can also use command-line options to execute console commands and set console variables, by preceding the console command or variable name with the &ldquo;+&rdquo; symbol.  This isn't terribly useful for most settings &ndash; usually you should instead just set them permanently in the config file or autoexec.cfg &ndash; but some console commands can be useful on the command line.  For example you could launch GLQuake directly into dm4 to practice your lava-diving with the command line<br/><div class="code"><pre>GLquake.exe +deathmatch 1 +map dm4</pre></div></p><p>That may not be the way you always want to launch Quake, but if it's something that you do from time to time, it could be handy to create a shortcut for it (as described below).</p><p>If you have a long series of console settings/commands that you want to execute on launch, you don't have to specify them all on the command line.  Instead you could put them in a file (for example named &ldquo;myscript.cfg&rdquo;) stored in some game directory visible to the Quake engine, and use the &ldquo;exec&rdquo; command to read that file:<br/><div class="code"><pre>GLquake.exe +exec myscript.cfg</pre></div></p><h3>&bull; Steam &ldquo;launch options&rdquo;</h3><p>You may be launching Quake using Steam, especially considering which website you're on right now!  Obviously you need to use Steam if you're running the Quake executables that Steam provides.  Also some folks replace those old executables with modern Quake engines but still launch them through Steam to take advantage of the Steam overlay, time-tracking, and just the convenience of having a unified launcher for all their games.  (This works fine if you rename the modern engine executable to have the same filename as the old executable that you're replacing.)</p><p>To set up command-line options for a Steam-launched Quake engine:</p><p><ul><li>In the Steam client, go to your Library and find Quake in the list of installed games.<br/></li><li>Get the context menu for that Quake item (in Windows: right-click on it) and select Properties at the bottom of that menu.  This opens the Properties dialog.<br/></li><li>The Properties dialog should appear with the General tab showing.  Near the bottom of the General tab is a button labelled &ldquo;Set launch options&rdquo;.<br/></li><li>Click the &ldquo;Set launch options&rdquo; button.  This opens a Launch Options dialog with a text box.<br/></li><li>Type any command-line options you want into this text box, and click OK.<br/></li></ul></p><p>The &ldquo;launch options&rdquo; that you set through Steam should make up all of the command line except the name of the program itself.  So to continue with our example of disabling CD audio, the text that you would enter into the &ldquo;launch options&rdquo; box would be<br/><div class="code"><pre>-nocdaudio</pre></div></p><p>like so:<br/><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/launchopts_trimmed.jpg" id="trigger-238594" class="guidePic sizeFull inline" /></p><p>Note that if you have not replaced the Quake programs that were downloaded by Steam, <strong>this is the only way to specify command-line options</strong>. If you try to start up of those Quake programs from a shell or shortcut or whatever means outside of Steam, it will still launch through Steam, and Quake will use the options (or lack of options) defined here in Steam's &ldquo;launch options&rdquo; dialog.</p><p>The potential issue with defining command-line options through Steam is that Steam only lets you specify one set of &ldquo;launch options&rdquo; for Quake.  But when you launch Quake you could be choosing to run Quake, GLQuake, QuakeWorld, or GLQuakeWorld.  The same set of launch options would be used with any of those.</p><p>In practice this isn't a problem because engines do share many common command-line options, and typically an engine will just ignore any options that it doesn't understand.  So for example if you have an option in &ldquo;launch options&rdquo; that only applies to GLQuake, and then you use Steam to launch GLQuakeWorld, you'll be sending a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; option to GLQuakeWorld&#8230; but it will probably ignore it and you'll be fine.  Just something to keep in mind.<br/></p><h3>&bull; OS mechanisms</h3><p>If you're running some modern/replacement Quake engine rather than the programs downloaded by Steam, you can also specify command-line options when launching Quake outside of Steam. The way to do this depends on your operating system.  The best solution for you may be a script, shortcut, batch file, or even holding down some modifier key when launching the program.  Completely covering all of these options is outside the scope of this guide, but I'll just mention one solution that is handy on Windows.</p><p>On Windows one way to provide command-line options is by using a shortcut:</p><p><ul><li>Find the executable for the Quake engine you want to launch.<br/></li><li>Right-click on it and drag to some open space (where you will be creating the shortcut).<br/></li><li>Release the right-click and a menu will pop up; choose &ldquo;Create shortcuts here&rdquo;.<br/></li><li>Now you have a shortcut.  Rename it if you like.<br/></li><li>Right-click on the shortcut and choose &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;.<br/></li><li>The Properties dialog should appear with the Shortcut tab visible.<br/></li><li>In the Shortcut tab there is a textbox labelled &ldquo;Target&rdquo;.<br/></li><li>Click inside the Target box and use arrow keys to move the cursor to the very end.<br/></li><li>At this spot you can add a space and then type any command-line options you want to use.<br/></li></ul></p><p><br/>Now whenever you open/execute this shortcut, just as if it were a program, you will launch Quake with your desired set of command-line options.</p><p>And that's about it for talking about the general ways to muck about with Quake configuration.  Now we'll cover some of the specifics.</p>  <h2 id="10">Mouselook</h2>
  <h3>&bull; Enable</h3><p>If you are using ezQuake, FTEQW, Fodquake, DarkPlaces, DirectQ, ProQuake, or Qrack then you already have mouselook enabled.  Good for you!</p><p>If you don't have mouselook enabled, then you need this line in your autoexec.cfg file:<br/><div class="code"><pre>+mlook</pre></div></p><p>If you are using QuakeSpasm or Fitzquake Mark V, you could also just enter &ldquo;+mlook&rdquo; in the console, and it will be saved to your config file.  The original Quake engines however do not save it to the config file, and you must put it in autoexec.cfg.</p><p>Note that you <strong>do not</strong> want to enable &ldquo;lookspring&rdquo; or &ldquo;lookstrafe&rdquo;.  Those behaviors get in the way of mouselook.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Invert</h3><p>You can choose to invert the mouse Y-axis using the in-game menu, but you can also set this behavior through the &ldquo;m_pitch&rdquo; console variable.  Non-inverted mouse behavior is<br/><div class="code"><pre>m_pitch 0.022</pre></div></p><p>and inverted mouse is<br/><div class="code"><pre>m_pitch -0.022</pre></div></p><p>This setting is saved in the config file.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Sensitivity</h3><p>The in-game menu gives you a way to change your mouse sensitivity, but it's faster to use the console if you want to experiment with different values.  The name of the console variable is &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo;.  This setting is saved in the config file.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Vertical auto-aim</h3><p>Some engines (QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, DirectQ, ProQuake, and the original Quake engines) enable some degree of vertical auto-aim by default.  This can be really frustrating when using mouselook.  To completely disable vertical auto-aim in singleplayer, have this line in your autoexec.cfg file:<br/><div class="code"><pre>sv_aim 1</pre></div></p><p>You may see guides that recommend &ldquo;sv_aim 2&rdquo;, and that's also fine.  All values of 1 or more will disable auto-aim.</p><p>When &ldquo;sv_aim&rdquo; is set to 1 (or more) on a server, it will disable auto-aim for all clients.</p><p>QuakeWorld servers have an &ldquo;sv_aim&rdquo; value of 2 by default, but if for some weird reason you are playing on a QuakeWorld server that has some degree of autoaim enabled (using an &ldquo;sv_aim&rdquo; value less than 1), you can opt out of that with this setting in your own configuration:<br/><div class="code"><pre>noaim 1</pre></div></p><p>(Using &ldquo;noaim 1&rdquo; will also slightly reduce the amount of processing the server does when you fire a projectile, although that doesn't really matter these days.)  In modern QuakeWorld clients &ldquo;noaim&rdquo; will be 1 by default.</p><p>In NetQuake the &ldquo;noaim&rdquo; setting doesn't exist, so you're at the mercy of the server settings.  But in practice any well-configured NetQuake or QuakeWorld server is going to have auto-aim disabled and you won't have to worry about this in multiplayer.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Mouse &ldquo;feel&rdquo;</h3><p>If you're picky about mouse input you may want to experiment with putting &ldquo;-dinput&rdquo; on the command line to enable DirectInput mouse processing.</p><p>If you prefer mouse smoothing, you can enable it with<br/><div class="code"><pre>m_filter 1</pre></div></p><p>If your engine of choice doesn't save that to its config file, then place it in autoexec.cfg.  (Note that QuakeSpasm and DirectQ don't support this variable at all.)</p><p>Different Quake engines also can provide different mouse feel.</p>  <h2 id="11">Movement</h2>
  <p>You can set &ldquo;Always Run&rdquo; using the in-game menus, but you can also set it through console variables.  By default the &ldquo;cl_forwardspeed&rdquo; and &ldquo;cl_backspeed&rdquo; variables each have a value of 200, but you can enable &ldquo;Always Run&rdquo; by increasing them to 400:<br/><div class="code"><pre>
cl_forwardspeed 400
cl_backspeed 400</pre></div></p><p>Values higher than 400 won't help you go any faster, by the way. :-)</p><p>These settings are saved in the config file.</p>  <h2 id="12">Widescreen</h2>
  <h3>&bull; GLQuake issues</h3><p>If you want to use the original GLQuake (rather than a modern Quake engine or GLQuakeWorld): it's worth mentioning that the version of GLQuake distributed with Steam has problems with widescreen options (among other things), as described in the &ldquo;GLQuake Version Issues&rdquo; section. Check that out before proceeding here.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Resolution</h3><p>For all modern Quake engines you can select your desired resolution using the in-game menus.</p><p>The original (non-GL) Quake or QuakeWorld engines have an in-game menu but they just do not support widescreen. You're out of luck with those.</p><p>For the original GLQuake or GLQuakeWorld engines, you have to use the command-line options &ldquo;-width&rdquo; and &ldquo;-height&rdquo; to specify your desired resolution, for example<br/><div class="code"><pre>-width 1920 -height 1080</pre></div></p><h3>&bull; Console dimensions</h3><p>Bear with me for a bit of explanation.</p><p>The original Quake engines use the pixel width and height of the console to determine the size and aspect ratio of some things &ndash; not just console text, but also the statusbar HUD, and even the way your weapon is rendered. The original 640x480 console dimensions are fine for 4:3 displays, but they lead to some weirdness in widescreen resolutions.</p><p>Some modern Quake engines inherit these issues.</p><p>If you use QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, DirectQ, ProQuake, or Qrack then you won't have aspect ratio problems. For QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, and DirectQ (at least) you can use other console variables to adjust the console text size and HUD size; as a starter check out the variables with names that begin with &ldquo;scr_con&rdquo; or &ldquo;scr_sbar&rdquo;.</p><p>Other engines may need a little more tweaking. Specifically, for proper widescreen display we want to specify new console dimensions, following two rules:</p><p><ul><li>The ratio between console width and height should be the same as the ratio between the width and height of your screen resolution. This prevents distortion of text, statusbar, and weapon.<br/></li><li>Console size (the magnitude of the width and height numbers) affects the size of console text and statusbar. Bigger console size means smaller text and statusbar.<br/></li></ul></p><p>I like to keep the console height as close to 480 as possible to match the original design. So for 16:10 displays I use 768x480 console dimensions; for 16:9 I use 864x486.</p><p>As an example here's a couple of images from GLQuake 0.98 using a 16:9 resolution. I haven't changed the FOV (field of view) yet &ndash; we'll get to that in the next section &ndash; so the FOV is still 90 degrees. In the top image the console dimensions haven't been changed yet; on the bottom they've been corrected to have a 16:9 aspect. Notice how on the top the HUD statusbar is stretched out and the weapon render is different. (And if you were to look at some console text in the top case, it would be horizontally stretched.)</p><p><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/1_res_view.jpg" id="trigger-236915" class="guidePic sizeFull inline" /></p><p><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/3_conres_view.jpg" id="trigger-236917" class="guidePic sizeFull inline" /></p><p>In ezQuake, FTEQW, Fodquake, and DarkPlaces, you can set the console dimensions using the &ldquo;vid_conwidth&rdquo; and &ldquo;vid_conheight&rdquo; console variables, which will save to the config file. So for a 16:9 resolution you could use<br/><div class="code"><pre>
vid_conwidth 864
vid_conheight 486</pre></div></p><p>or for 16:10 you could use<br/><div class="code"><pre>
vid_conwidth 768
vid_conheight 480</pre></div></p><p><br/>Quirks to be aware of:</p><p><ul><li>You may need to set these values <em>after</em> choosing a screen resolution using the in-game menu, in case that action resets them.<br/></li><li>FTEQW doesn't have HUD aspect ratio problems, but the HUD will be very small unless you adjust these values.<br/></li><li>Fodquake doesn't have HUD aspect ratio problems, and the HUD looks pretty good by default, but you can change these values to adjust the HUD size if you like.<br/></li><li>ezQuake users should see the &ldquo;Special note for ezQuake&rdquo; below.<br/></li></ul></p><p><br/>Finally: for the original GLQuake (version 0.97 or 0.98) or GLQuakeWorld, those console variables do not exist; instead you need to use the command-line options &ldquo;-conwidth&rdquo; and &ldquo;-conheight&rdquo;. So these would be good GLQuake/GLQuakeWorld command-line options for a 16:9 resolution:<br/><div class="code"><pre>-conwidth 864 -conheight 486</pre></div></p><p>or for a 16:10 resolution:<br/><div class="code"><pre>-conwidth 768 -conheight 480</pre></div></p><h3>&bull; FOV</h3><p>The original field of view for Quake is 90 degrees horizontally. If you are used to this for a 4:3 resolution, then when you switch to a widescreen resolution it can seem cramped and even make you motionsick.</p><p>A larger FOV can also just give you an advantage from seeing more, although if you increase it too much you get fisheye effects that can be disorienting and make it harder to aim. In the end the right setting is a matter of personal taste.</p><p>I use an FOV of 100 horizontal degrees for 16:10 resolutions, or 106 for 16:9, since these horizontal FOV settings result in approximately the same vertical FOV that I was used to on a 4:3 display. For example, the top image here uses a 90 degree FOV on a 4:3 display (like original Quake); the bottom image uses 106 FOV on a 16:9 display. Notice how in both images you can see the same amount of your surroundings vertically, and the 16:9 display shows more stuff to the left and right.</p><p><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/ogfov_padded.png" id="trigger-238404" class="guidePic sizeFull inline" /></p><p><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/5_fov_view.jpg" id="trigger-236923" class="guidePic sizeFull inline" /></p><p>In all Quake engines, FOV is adjusted by setting a value for the console variable &ldquo;fov&rdquo;. The value for &ldquo;fov&rdquo; may or may not be saved to the config file; if not, it needs to be placed in your autoexec.cfg file. See the examples at the end of this guide for engine-by-engine specifics. ezQuake users should also see the &ldquo;Special note for ezQuake&rdquo; below.</p><p><blockquote><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/tmyk.jpg" id="trigger-236895" class="guidePic sizeOriginal floatLeft" /> Often the value for &ldquo;fov&rdquo; is just the horizontal FOV that you want. So for example if you want an FOV of 106 degrees, you set &ldquo;fov&rdquo; to 106. But QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, and Fodquake interpret the &ldquo;fov&rdquo; value specifically as &ldquo;the field of view for a 4:3 display&rdquo;. If you have a screen resolution in a different aspect ratio, the engine will automatically adjust your view to keep the same vertical field of view that you would have in a 4:3 resolution.<br/><br/>Note that QuakeSpasm versions 0.85.8 and earlier do not have this auto-adjustment feature. In QuakeSpasm 0.85.9 and later, you can also choose to disable auto-adjustment by setting &ldquo;fov_adapt&rdquo; to 0. When auto-adjustment is disabled, the QuakeSpasm FOV behaves like GLQuake and most other engines, where you just directly set it to the value you want.<br/><br/>As far as I know you can't disable the auto-adjustment in Fodquake or in Fitzquake Mark V.<br/></blockquote></p><h3>&bull; Special note for ezQuake</h3><p>ezQuake has a menu option called &ldquo;Wide Aspect&rdquo; which can be enabled or disabled. This corresponds to values of 1 or 0 for the &ldquo;vid_wideaspect&rdquo; console variable.</p><p>If you enable this setting, ezQuake does the following things:</p><p><ul><li>assume that your console dimensions and FOV are currently set the way you like for a 4:3 display<br/></li><li>assume that you want to change these things to be appropriate for a 16:10 display<br/></li><li>increase the horizontal FOV so that the 16:10 display will have the same vertical FOV as the 4:3 display did<br/></li><li>decrease the console height so that the console aspect ratio is 16:10<br/></li></ul></p><p><br/>If you later <em>dis</em>able this setting, then ezQuake munges console dimensions and FOV with the intent of going back from 16:10 settings to 4:3 settings.</p><p>This can be handy if you have a 16:10 display, as long as you don't mind that it shrinks the console height a bit. However if you have a 16:9 display, or if you want more direct control over FOV and console dimensions, leave this setting alone and instead modify the &ldquo;vid_conwidth&rdquo;, &ldquo;vid_conheight&rdquo;, and &ldquo;fov&rdquo; variables as described above.</p>  <h2 id="13">More HUD Tweaks</h2>
  <h3>&bull; Console speed</h3><p>In some Quake engines, by default when you open the console it animates down from the top of the screen fairly slowly.  If you would rather not wait on this, you can change the animation speed with this setting:<br/><div class="code"><pre>scr_conspeed 9999</pre></div></p><h3>&bull; Crosshair</h3><p>Us weak 21st-century gamers can't get along without a crosshair.  Enable the crosshair by entering<br/><div class="code"><pre>crosshair 1</pre></div></p><p>in the console.  This value will be saved to your config file.</p><p>Modern Quake engines may support drawing different crosshair styles if you set &ldquo;crosshair&rdquo; to other nonzero values.  They may also have support for crosshair choice in the in-game menus.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Weapon display</h3><p>If the view of your weapon model is just getting in your way, you can remove it with this setting:<br/><div class="code"><pre>r_drawviewmodel 0</pre></div></p>  <h2 id="14">Key Bindings</h2>
  <p>One of the most interesting things you can do with the console and config file is &ldquo;key binding&rdquo;: controlling what happens when you press a specific key.  Key bindings are saved to your config file.</p><p>Open the config file in a text editor and look at what is bound to the number keys, the keys that you usually use to select weapons.  For most engines, as an example, you'll see this line partway down the file:<br/><div class="code"><pre>bind 7 "impulse 7"</pre></div></p><p>This just means that when you press the 7 key, it should execute the console command &ldquo;impulse 7&rdquo;, which happens to select the rocket launcher.</p><p>In most engines you can use the &ldquo;bindlist&rdquo; console command to call up a display of which keys do what.</p><p>A good description of key binding is out of scope for this guide, but you may want to search out more details.  Quake players have sometimes gone a little crazy setting up detailed and complex things to happen at the push of a button.</p><p>One specific thing that Steam users may want to pay attention to is the screenshot key.  Search the config file for the &ldquo;screenshot&rdquo; command, and for most engines you'll see something like this:<br/><div class="code"><pre>bind F12 "screenshot"</pre></div></p><p>If F12 is your Steam screenshot key then this is redundant.  To prevent F12 from triggering the Quake screenshot function, you can delete this line from your config file, or else while Quake is running use the console to enter the command<br/><div class="code"><pre>unbind F12</pre></div></p>  <h2 id="15">Oldschool Texturing</h2>
  <p>If you're interested in re-creating the original Quake appearance then you should read the page at quaddicted.com about <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/engines/software_vs_glquake">differences between software rendered Quake and GLQuake</a>.</p><p>One of the basic takeaways from that page is that you may want to change the texture filtering in Quake to make it more &ldquo;pixel-y&rdquo;.  The quaddicted.com page has several comparison shots, but here's another (click for large versions to best see the difference):<br/><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/filtered.png" id="trigger-237206" class="guidePic sizeThumb floatLeft" /> <img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/pixel.png" id="trigger-237207" class="guidePic sizeThumb floatRight" /></p><p>The left image is the familiar GLQuake filtered look; the right image is still an OpenGL renderer but its textures look more like the original software Quake.</p><p>If you are using an engine with an OpenGL renderer then you can do this with a console variable:<br/><div class="code"><pre>gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR</pre></div></p><p>Some engines will save this to the config file, but in other cases you'll need to put it in autoexec.cfg to make it stick.</p><p>This same console variable is also available in DirectQ and the Direct3D version of ProQuake, even though they use a Direct3D renderer.</p><p>I'm not aware of how to do this for the Direct3D mode of FTEQW.</p>  <h2 id="16">Sound</h2>
  <p>For information about soundtrack music and sound sample rate, see this guide: <a href="soundtrack_solutions.html"><img src="../../images/guides/common/neo.png" class="linkBadge"></img> Quake Soundtrack Solutions</a><br/></p>  <h2 id="17">Limits</h2>
  <p>The original Quake engines, and to some extent modern engines as well, have hard limits on how much memory they can use for certain purposes.</p><p>Two of the primary limits can be manipulated using the &ldquo;-zone&rdquo; and &ldquo;-heapsize&rdquo; command-line options for most engines.  Broadly speaking, &ldquo;-zone&rdquo; controls memory allocated to console scripts, and &ldquo;-heapsize&rdquo; the general memory pool used during gameplay.  Both are expressed in kilobytes.</p><p>If you have a reasonable amount of RAM, then you can easily blow out both of these values large enough to be sufficient for just about any use of Quake, such as:<br/><div class="code"><pre>-zone 2048 -heapsize 192000</pre></div></p><p>That's less than 200MB of memory allocated for Quake, and it would be verrrrrry unusual for any bit of Quake content to need more than that.</p><p>In any case, if you download something like a map or mod to try out, be sure to check the readme file.  It may contain requirements for these command-line options or for some console variables that control other limits.</p>  <h2 id="18">Cutting to the Chase</h2>
  <p>Hopefully the above sections help to show what options are out there and how to change them, but to wrap things up I'll summarize what I use for running Quake in the next couple of sections.</p><p>Note that I don't use most of these engines very often.  If you notice something that I'm doing wrong please let me know!</p><p><strong>And keep in mind that the values shown below are specifically for the settings I personally like to use.</strong>  If you use a different resolution, FOV, or whatever then the rest of the guide above should help you determine what values to use.</p><p>I usually set my mouse sensitivity and Y-invert through the console, but that's not shown below.  I also &ldquo;unbind F12&rdquo; (the default screenshot key) to avoid a conflict with the Steam overlay screenshot key&#8230; if you launch Quake through Steam then you'll probably want to do the same, if not then not.</p>  <h2 id="19">Command Line Examples</h2>
  <h3>&bull; Modern Quake engines</h3><p>For modern Quake engines, my command line options tend to be<br/><div class="code"><pre>-dinput -heapsize 192000</pre></div></p><p>Or sometimes (see the Quake Soundtrack Solutions guide for more info) I use<br/><div class="code"><pre>-dinput -heapsize 192000 -sndspeed 44100</pre></div></p><p><br/>I don't bother with the &ldquo;-zone&rdquo; option since I don't have gigantic console scripts, and many of the modern Quake engines no longer use the &ldquo;-zone&rdquo; option anyway.</p><p>The &ldquo;-dinput&rdquo; option is irrelevant for DirectQ, and &ldquo;-heapsize&rdquo; is ignored by a few engines (Fodquake, DarkPlaces, DirectQ), but it doesn't hurt to specify them.  So I'm lazy enough to just always use the same command line.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Original Quake engines</h3><p>I would use these options for Quake/QuakeWorld:<br/><div class="code"><pre>-dinput -heapsize 192000</pre></div></p><p><br/>For GLQuake/GLQuakeWorld I would use these for 1920x1080:<br/><div class="code"><pre>-dinput -heapsize 192000 -width 1920 -height 1080 -conwidth 864 -conheight 486</pre></div></p><p>or these for 1920x1200:<br/><div class="code"><pre>-dinput -heapsize 192000 -width 1920 -height 1200 -conwidth 768 -conheight 480</pre></div></p><p><br/>(Assuming version 0.98 for GLQuake; it's not worth putting up with earlier versions in my opinion.)</p>  <h2 id="20">Console Settings Examples</h2>
  <h3>&bull; ezQuake, FTEQW, and Fodquake</h3><p>When it comes to console settings, these three popular QuakeWorld clients can be treated a little differently than other engines.  So let's tackle them first.<br/></p><p><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/ezQuake32.png" id="trigger-237127" class="guidePic sizeOriginal inline" />ezQuake  <img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/FTEQW32.png" id="trigger-237129" class="guidePic sizeOriginal inline" /> FTEQW  <img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/Fodquake32.png" id="trigger-237128" class="guidePic sizeOriginal inline" /> Fodquake</p><p>A quick way to get a bunch of settings into one of these engines is to put the settings all into some file in the &ldquo;id1&rdquo; folder, start up Quake, and then use the &ldquo;exec&rdquo; console command to read that file.  For example if you have your settings in the file &ldquo;foo.cfg&rdquo;, you can import those settings with the console command<br/><div class="code"><pre>exec foo.cfg</pre></div></p><p><br/>Next you should explicitly save the settings to your config file with this console command:<br/><div class="code"><pre>cfg_save</pre></div></p><p>or by using the appropriate menu option to save settings/configuration.</p><p>These are the settings that I would use for those engines after choosing a 16:9 resolution like 1920x1080 in the in-game menus:<br/><div class="code"><pre>
cl_backspeed 400
cl_forwardspeed 400
gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
scr_conspeed 9999
vid_conwidth 864
vid_conheight 486</pre></div></p><p>or these settings after picking a 16:10 resolution like 1920x1200:<br/><div class="code"><pre>
cl_backspeed 400
cl_forwardspeed 400
gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
scr_conspeed 9999
vid_conwidth 768
vid_conheight 480</pre></div></p><p><br/>For ezQuake or FTEQW I would also include a setting of &ldquo;fov 106&rdquo; or &ldquo;fov 100&rdquo;, respectively, to fix the field of view.  For Fodquake I'd leave &ldquo;fov&rdquo; at its default value of 90 since Fodquake internally takes care of increasing the field of view for widescreen resolutions.</p><p>You can also experiment with different values (or menu choices) for the &ldquo;crosshair&rdquo; variable.<br/></p><h3>&bull; Other modern Quake engines</h3><p>For all other modern Quake engines, some of the settings may be automatically saved to your config, and some may not be.  One way to deal with this is just to put them all into your autoexec.cfg file so that they get set every time Quake launches.</p><p>Of course this means that some settings will end up both in your config file and in autoexec.cfg.  If you think that could lead to some confusion, then you can pare down your autoexec.cfg file &ndash; delete any lines that contain settings covered by the config file.  It's up to you how you want to handle that.</p><p>So generally speaking these are the settings that I like:<br/><div class="code"><pre>
cl_backspeed 400
cl_forwardspeed 400
crosshair 1
fov 106
gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
scr_conspeed 9999
sv_aim 1
+mlook</pre></div></p><p>(or &ldquo;fov 100&rdquo; for a 16:10 resolution like 1920x1200)</p><p>I could get away with just throwing those into autoexec.cfg.  Some are redundant or unnecessary for some modern Quake engines.  And for DarkPlaces I'd also want to fix &ldquo;vid_conwidth&rdquo; and &ldquo;vid_conheight&rdquo;.  But that's the general idea.</p><p>If you want specifics about which of those settings are needed for which engines, and which are saved to the config, then I've captured below the way it looked to me when I tested each engine.<br/></p><p><img src="../../images/guides/owners_manual/DarkPlaces32.png" id="trigger-237062" class="guidePic sizeOriginal inline" />DarkPlaces</p><p>These settings will be saved to the config file:<br/><div class="code"><pre>

  <p>The <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/jlaw/screenshots/?appid=2310&amp;sort=newestfirst&amp;browsefilter=myfiles&amp;view=imagewall">singleplayer Quake screenshots in my Steam account</a> were all taken using some variety of Fitzquake &ndash; either QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, or the original Fitzquake.  Along with the basic settings described in this guide I typically use the following settings when I play singleplayer in those engines:<br/><div class="code"><pre>

scr_sbarscale "1.5"
scr_crosshairscale "2"
gl_texture_anisotropy "8.000000"</pre></div></p><p>&#8230;and so I was probably using something like that when taking screenshots, but no guarantees. :-)</p><p>(Small update: any screenshots of &ldquo;Something Wicked This Way Comes&rdquo; used the Dec 2012 experimental build of FTEQW.)</p><p><img src="http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/595844459738802262/C753344363900D8B511FA0AC326B5CD69922667D/" id="trigger-s71192457" class="guidePic sizeThumb floatLeft"></img> <img src="http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/596966794426164940/63196C2E15D7A435A1716D0B32E4795E96A8B7B3/" id="trigger-s2386919" class="guidePic sizeThumb floatRight"></img><br/><img src="http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/596942125434007093/1633882E5E4BDF4DA2C2BFE039E653B664E81582/" id="trigger-s2387085" class="guidePic sizeThumb floatLeft"></img> <img src="http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/596942125552595317/8B8F9741E2AB8E7800A155A45BB7903C575C4F46/" id="trigger-s2387084" class="guidePic sizeThumb floatRight"></img></p>  <h2 id="22">More Info</h2>
