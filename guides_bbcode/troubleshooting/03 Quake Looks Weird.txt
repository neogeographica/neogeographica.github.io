[h1]Wacky colors in WinQuake/QuakeWorld[/h1]
You may see a technicolor mess when launching Quake (WinQuake) or QuakeWorld. These two original Quake engines use DirectDraw in a way that is not well-supported in modern Windows.

The problem may fix itself when the first "screen flash" effect happens. This is my experience when running WinQuake; the colors correct themselves during the opening attract reel.

QuakeWorld doesn't have an attract reel and launches straight into the console. You can type "bf" (without the quotes) and press Enter to force a screen flash which, for me, fixes the colors.

Also the PC Gaming Wiki [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Rainbow_color_problems_in_older_games]describes a way to fix common DirectDraw color issues in old games[/url] which may be helpful for Quake, but I haven't tried that myself. A [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/2310/discussions/0/828938532947217168/]forum thread[/url] has other possible solutions.

If you use GLQuake or GLQuakeWorld, you won't have this issue. Modern Quake engines, which you can read about in the Quake Engines guide, also don't have this issue.

If you feel that you don't want to use a modern Quake engine because you are really attached to the original look of software-rendered Quake, here's a couple of things to consider:
[list]
[*]Some modern engines can be configured to look a lot like software-rendered Quake. Look for the "faithful rendering" engines mentioned in the Quake Engines guide; also, see the "Oldschool Texturing" section of the Quake Owner's Manual guide.
[*]Engoo, a modern software-renderer Quake engine, has a mode that explicitly attempts to look exactly like the original Quake.

This is a bit of a long shot, but if you see a screen full of corrupted/glitchy graphics, it could be because you need to force 32-bit color depth to make your graphics drivers happy. See the "Color Depth" section of the Quake Owner's Manual guide.

This is a surprising one, but if you're on Windows 8 then it's a specific problem with an easy fix. The answer is to disable "display scaling on high DPI settings". You don't have to globally disable it; you can disable it just in the properties for the Quake program that you're running.
