[h1]Wacky colors in WinQuake/QuakeWorld[/h1]
You may see a technicolor mess when launching Quake (WinQuake) or QuakeWorld. These two original Quake engines use DirectDraw in a way that is not well-supported in modern Windows.

The problem may fix itself when the first "screen flash" effect happens. This is my experience when running WinQuake; the colors correct themselves during the opening attract reel.

QuakeWorld doesn't have an attract reel and launches straight into the console. You can type "bf" (without the quotes) and press Enter to force a screen flash which, for me, fixes the colors.

If your problems with this issue are more persistent, then [url=http://sol.gfxile.net/ddhack/]ddhack[/url] may help; also the PC Gaming Wiki [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Rainbow_color_problems_in_older_games]describes a way to fix common DirectDraw color issues in old games[/url] which may apply to WinQuake/QuakeWorld. However I haven't tried any of those solutions myself.

This is a bit of a long shot, but if you see a screen full of corrupted/glitchy graphics, it could be because you need to force 32-bit color depth to make your graphics drivers happy. See the "Color Depth" section of the Quake Owner's Manual guide. Note that this doesn't apply if you're using an engine with a software renderer.

This is a surprising one, but if you're on Windows 8 (and perhaps later Windows versions) then it's a specific problem with an easy fix. The answer is to disable "display scaling on high DPI settings". You don't have to globally disable it; you can disable it just in the properties for the Quake program that you're running.
