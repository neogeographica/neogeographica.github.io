[h1]Music sounds muffled[/h1]
If you're using a Quake engine that plays the soundtrack music from files, check that you're using the latest version of that engine. Particularly, if you're using QuakeSpasm, make sure that you have version 0.85.10 or later. The "Sample Rate" section of the Quake Soundtrack Solutions guide has more discussion.
