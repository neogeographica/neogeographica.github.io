[h1]No video options menu[/h1]
The original GLQuake/GLQuakeWorld and some GLQuake-based engines don't have an in-game video options menu. You have to use command-line arguments to set your resolution for these engines. See the "Display: Resolution" section of the Quake Owner's Manual guide, as well as the "Command Line Examples" at the end of the guide.

[h1]Video options menu doesn't have widescreen choices[/h1]
The original Quake (WinQuake) and QuakeWorld engines each have a video options menu, but don't support widescreen settings.

Some people have reported good results using [url=http://sol.gfxile.net/ddhack/]ddhack[/url] to enable widescreen options in WinQuake, and perhaps it would also be helpful for QuakeWorld. I haven't tried it myself in either case though.

If you really want widescreen you may have to use some other Quake engine.
