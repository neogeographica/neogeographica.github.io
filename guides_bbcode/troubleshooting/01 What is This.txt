Other guides cover Quake configuration, but they're organized topically; if you're experiencing a problem it can be hard to find the solution. This guide is arranged according to the roadblocks you might hit when trying to get Quake up and running.

For each symptom, this guide will tell you what the problem is and how to (hopefully) solve it. To keep things concise, usually you'll be redirected from here to the section of some other guide that describes the fix.

You'll need to be comfortable with a few concepts:

First, you should know what a "Quake engine" is. If you don't, this guide should clear things up: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118401000

Also, most of the fixes involve using "console variables" or "command-line arguments". If you aren't familiar with how to work with those things in Quake, see the sections from "The Config File" through "The Command Line" in this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=120426294

Those two guides will also be referenced a lot below. Guide links take up a lot of screen space, so I won't link to them again.

Let's get started. Each section below contains a few similar problems, so check the titles inside each section to look for the symptom that's bugging you.
