[h1]Can't see the statusbar[/h1]
Probably your "viewsize" is too big. Hit the minus key to see if that makes the statusbar appear. Maybe hit it again a few times if necessary. :-) If you go too far and start actually reducing the size of the rendered screen area, you can use the plus key to go back. The "Display" section of the Quake Owner's Manual guide has a bit more about viewsize.

(Another reason you might not be seeing a statusbar is DPI scaling, described in the "It only takes up one quarter of the screen" issue of the "Quake Looks Weird" section above.)

[h1]Statusbar is "stretched"[/h1]
Several Quake engines will have this problem when using a widescreen resolution. The fix depends on which engine you're using. See the "Display" and "Display: HUD" sections of the Quake Owner's Manual guide, as well as the "Console Settings Examples" at the end of the guide.

[h1]Field of view is cramped[/h1]
This is another common issue when trying to use widescreen resolutions. See the "Display" and "Display: FOV" sections of the Quake Owner's Manual guide, as well as the "Console Settings Examples" at the end of the guide.

[h1]Where's my crosshair?[/h1]
If you don't have a crosshair (and you want one), and you're using a modern Quake engine, then you might be able to find an option to turn on the crosshair in the options menus. Otherwise you can use a console variable to enable it; see the "More HUD Tweaks" section of the Quake Owner's Manual guide.

[h1]Where's my weapon?[/h1]
If your weapon isn't being shown on-screen, it's probably for one of two reasons:
[list]
[*]If you're using the original non-GL versions of Quake (WinQuake) or QuakeWorld, your weapon will disappear if you change the "fov" console variable to have any value other than 90. If you want to have a different FOV and still see your gun model, you'll need to use some other Quake engine.
[*]If that's not it, then check the value of the "r_drawviewmodel" console variable. A value of "0" for that variable will hide the gun model, and value of "1" will show it.

[h1]Fog has color banding[/h1]
You might be running with a 16-bit color depth instead of 32-bit. See the "Color Depth" section of the Quake Owner's Manual guide. Note that this doesn't apply if you're using an engine with a software renderer.
