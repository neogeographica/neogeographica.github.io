When it comes to console settings, the three popular QuakeWorld clients can be treated a little differently than other engines.  So let's tackle them first.

A quick way to get a bunch of settings into one of these engines is to put the settings all into some file in the "id1" folder, start up Quake, and then use the "exec" console command to read that file.  For example if you have your settings in the file "foo.cfg", you can import those settings with the console command
[code]exec foo.cfg[/code]

Next you should explicitly save the settings to your config file with this console command:
[code]cfg_save[/code]
or by using the appropriate menu option to save settings/configuration.

These are the settings that I would use for those engines after choosing a 16:9 resolution like 1920x1080 in the in-game menus:
[code]
cl_backspeed 400
cl_forwardspeed 400
gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
scr_conspeed 9999
vid_conwidth 864
vid_conheight 486
[/code]
or these settings after picking a 16:10 resolution like 1920x1200:
[code]
cl_backspeed 400
cl_forwardspeed 400
gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
scr_conspeed 9999
vid_conwidth 768
vid_conheight 480
[/code]

For ezQuake or FTEQW I would also include a setting of "fov 106" or "fov 100", respectively, to fix the field of view.  For Fodquake I'd leave "fov" at its default value of 90 since Fodquake internally takes care of increasing the field of view for widescreen resolutions.

You can also experiment with different values (or menu choices) for the "crosshair" variable.
