You can set "Always Run" using the in-game menus, but you can also set it through console variables.  By default the "cl_forwardspeed" and "cl_backspeed" variables each have a value of 200, but you can enable "Always Run" by increasing them to 400:
[code]
cl_forwardspeed 400
cl_backspeed 400
[/code]
Values higher than 400 won't help you go any faster, by the way. :-)

These settings are saved in the config file.
