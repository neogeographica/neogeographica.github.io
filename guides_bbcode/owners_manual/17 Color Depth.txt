GLQuake originally supported using either 16-bit color or 32-bit color, since early graphics cards and drivers might perform poorly or not at all with 32-bit color.

These days however, if you're not using a software-renderer engine then 32-bit color is probably what you want. In fact your Quake engine and/or graphics card/driver may not even support 16-bit color, or will at least default to 32-bit color.

But if you want to make sure that 32-bit color is being used, it's not a bad idea to be explicit about that with a command-line option:
[code]-bpp 32[/code]
