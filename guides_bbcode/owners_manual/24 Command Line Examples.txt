[h1]Modern Quake engines[/h1]
For modern Quake engines, my command line options tend to be
[code]-dinput -heapsize 192000 -bpp 32[/code]
Or sometimes (see the Quake Soundtrack Solutions guide for more info) I use
[code]-dinput -heapsize 192000 -sndspeed 44100 -bpp 32[/code]

(When using the qbism Super8 engine, I omit the "-bpp 32" option.)

I don't bother with the "-zone" option since I don't have gigantic console scripts, and many of the modern Quake engines no longer use the "-zone" option anyway.

The "-dinput" option is irrelevant for DirectQ, and "-heapsize" is ignored by a few engines (Fodquake, DarkPlaces, DirectQ), but it doesn't hurt to specify them.  So I'm lazy enough to just always use the same command line.

[h1]Original Quake engines[/h1]
I would use these options for Quake/QuakeWorld:
[code]-dinput -heapsize 192000 -bpp 32[/code]

For GLQuake/GLQuakeWorld I would use these for 1920x1080:
[code]-dinput -heapsize 192000 -width 1920 -height 1080 -conwidth 864 -conheight 486 -bpp 32[/code]
or these for 1920x1200:
[code]-dinput -heapsize 192000 -width 1920 -height 1200 -conwidth 768 -conheight 480 -bpp 32[/code]

(Assuming version 0.98 for GLQuake; it's not worth putting up with earlier versions in my opinion.)
