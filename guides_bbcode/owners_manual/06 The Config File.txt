[h1]Basic Configuration[/h1]
Changes that you make using the in-game menu, and some other changes that we'll get to in a minute, are stored in a file.

The name and location of this file depends on which Quake engine you are using.  The Quake Engines guide (linked at the top of this guide) covers this, but if you're in too much of a hurry for that, then here's the short form:
[list]
[*]If you run "Quake" or "GLQuake" from Steam, configuration will be stored in a file named "config.cfg" in the "id1" folder of your Quake installation.
[/list]
[list]
[*]If you run "QuakeWorld" or "GLQuakeWorld" from Steam, configuration will be stored in a file named "config.cfg" in the "qw" folder of your Quake installation.
[/list]
Steam will normally install Quake in the "steamapps\common\quake" folder under your Steam folder.

Modern Quake engines may have different ideas about where to store their configuration, and if you want more specifics about that then you'll have to hop over to the "Engine Coexistence" section of the Quake Engines guide.

[h1]Missionpacks and Mods[/h1]
Playing a mod or missionpack can have an effect on how your configuration is stored.

A mod or missionpack consists of additional files that are placed in their own subfolder, parallel to "id1" and "qw".  When you want to play the mod/missionpack in singleplayer, you use the "-game" command-line option to select that folder, according to the instructions in the mod's readme file.  (Command-line options are covered in another section below.) negke's guide to custom maps/mods discusses that: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=166554615
But just as a quick example, if you have a mod stored in the "travail" folder, then to activate it, one of your command-line options would need to be
[code]-game travail[/code]

We'll ignore QuakeWorld, GLQuakeWorld, and Fodquake for this section; those engines don't support singleplayer.

For ezQuake and FTEQW, the "-game" option doesn't affect the config file -- possibly because even though these engines have some singleplayer support, they are primarily aimed at QuakeWorld multiplayer.

For all other Quake engines though, when you use the "-game" option to specify a folder, your configuration will be stored in that folder.  If no config file exists there, then it will first be copied over from its original location (which is usually in the "id1" folder, or the "qrack" folder in the case of the Qrack engine).  So when you first start up a mod, you should see your familiar configuration.

While running a mod, you may want to make changes specific to that mod, such as binding a key to a new weapon.  Any changes you make to your configuration while using a particular "-game" folder will only affect the config file in that folder.
