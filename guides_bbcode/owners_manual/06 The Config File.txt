[h1]Basic Configuration[/h1]
Changes that you make using the in-game menu, and some other changes that we'll get to in a minute, are stored in a file.

The name and location of this file depends on which Quake engine you are using.  For the original Quake engines, the rules are simple:
[list]
[*]If you run Quake (WinQuake) or GLQuake, configuration will be stored in a file named "config.cfg" in the "id1" folder of your Quake installation. (This is the only config file that will be saved in the Steam Cloud when launching through Steam.)
[/list]
[list]
[*]If you run QuakeWorld or GLQuakeWorld, configuration will be stored in a file named "config.cfg" in the "qw" folder of your Quake installation.
[/list]
For example, Steam will normally install Quake in the "steamapps\common\quake" folder under your Steam folder, so in that case the config files will be placed in the "steamapps\common\quake\id1" folder or the "steamapps\common\quake\qw" folder.

Modern Quake engines may have different ideas about where to store their configuration. Many engines still just use "id1\config.cfg", but some engines use different files:
[list]
[*]Engoo: "id1\config.cfg" (for original Quake settings) and also "id1\config.rc" (for Engoo-specific settings)
[*]Qrack: "qrack\config.cfg"
[*]qbism Super8: "super8\super8.cfg"
[*]ezQuake: "ezQuake\configs\config.cfg"
[*]FTEQW: "fte.cfg" somewhere under your user directory; on Windows for example this config file is stored in "My Games\FTE QuakeWorld\fte" under your personal documents folder
[*]Fodquake: "default.cfg" somewhere under your user directory; on Windows for example this config file is stored in "Fodquake\fodquake\configs" under your personal documents folder
[/list]

[h1]Missionpacks and Mods[/h1]
Playing a mod or missionpack can have an effect on how your configuration is stored.

A mod or missionpack consists of additional files that are placed in their own subfolder, parallel to "id1" and "qw".  When you want to play the mod/missionpack in singleplayer, you use a command-line option to select that folder, according to the instructions in the mod's readme file.  (Command-line options are covered in another section below.) negke's guide to custom maps/mods discusses that: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=166554615

We'll ignore QuakeWorld, GLQuakeWorld, and Fodquake for this section; those engines don't support singleplayer.

For ezQuake and FTEQW, playing a mod doesn't affect the location of the config file -- probably because even though these engines have some singleplayer support, they are primarily aimed at QuakeWorld multiplayer.

For all other Quake engines, when you play a mod your configuration will be stored in that folder.  If no config file exists there, then it will first be copied over from its original location.  So when you first start up a mod, you should see your familiar configuration.

While running a mod, you may want to make changes specific to that mod, such as binding a key to a new weapon.  Any changes you make to your configuration while using a particular mod will only affect the config file in that folder.
