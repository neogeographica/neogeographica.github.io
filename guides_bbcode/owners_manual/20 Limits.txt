The original Quake engines, and to some extent modern engines as well, have hard limits on how much memory they can use for certain purposes.

Two of the primary limits can be manipulated using the "-zone" and "-heapsize" command-line options for most engines.  Broadly speaking, "-zone" controls memory allocated to console scripts, and "-heapsize" the general memory pool used during gameplay.  Both are expressed in kilobytes.

If you have a reasonable amount of RAM, then you can easily blow out both of these values large enough to be sufficient for just about any use of Quake, such as:
[code]-zone 2048 -heapsize 192000[/code]
That's less than 200MB of memory allocated for Quake, and it would be verrrrrry unusual for any bit of Quake content to need more than that.

In any case, if you download something like a map or mod to try out, be sure to check the readme file.  It may contain requirements for these command-line options or for some console variables that control other limits.
