For all other modern Quake engines, some of the settings may be automatically saved to your config, and some may not be.  One way to deal with this is just to put them all into your autoexec.cfg file so that they get set every time Quake launches.

Of course this means that some settings will end up both in your config file and in autoexec.cfg.  If you think that could lead to some confusion, then you can pare down your autoexec.cfg file -- delete any lines that contain settings covered by the config file.  It's up to you how you want to handle that.

So generally speaking these are the settings that I like:
[code]
cl_backspeed 400
cl_forwardspeed 400
crosshair 1
fov 106
gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
scr_conspeed 9999
sv_aim 1
+mlook
[/code]
(or "fov 100" for a 16:10 resolution like 1920x1200)

I could get away with just throwing those into autoexec.cfg.  Some are redundant or unnecessary for some modern Quake engines.  And for DarkPlaces and Qrack I'd also want to fix "vid_conwidth" and "vid_conheight".  But that's the general idea.

If you want specifics about which of those settings are needed for which engines, and which are saved to the config, then I've captured below the way it looked to me when I tested each engine.

These settings will be saved to the config file:
[code]
cl_backspeed 400
cl_forwardspeed 400
fov 106
vid_conwidth 864
vid_conheight 486
[/code]
(or "fov 100", "vid_conwidth 768", and "vid_conheight 480" for a 16:10 resolution like 1920x1200)

You can also experiment with different values for the "crosshair" variable.

This setting is not saved in the config file (must be in autoexec.cfg):
[code]
gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR

These settings will be saved to the config file:
[code]
cl_backspeed 400
cl_forwardspeed 400
crosshair 1
gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
scr_conspeed 9999
+mlook
[/code]

These settings are not saved in the config file (must be in autoexec.cfg):
[code]
sv_aim 1
[/code]
I'd leave "fov" at its default value of 90 since QuakeSpasm 0.85.9 and later versions internally take care of increasing the field of view for widescreen resolutions.  If you do need to change "fov" then you must put it in autoexec.cfg.

These settings will be saved to the config file:
[code]
cl_backspeed 400

crosshair 1
r_filter 0
sv_aim 1
[/code]

These settings are not saved in the config file (must be in autoexec.cfg):
[code]
scr_conspeed 9999
+mlook
[/code]
I'd leave "fov" at its default value of 90 since Engoo internally takes care of increasing the field of view for widescreen resolutions.  If you do need to change "fov" then you must put it in autoexec.cfg.

Also note that while I'm using "+mlook" to enable mouselook (for consistency), there's also another way to handle that with Engoo; see the "Mouselook" section for details.
