[h1]Quake (WinQuake) and QuakeWorld[/h1]
In these two original Quake engines, you can set your desired video resolution using in-game menus, although you will not be able to choose widescreen resolutions.

Note that the in-game menus allow you to pick a resolution as the "default". For these two engines, you need to select a default resolution if you want Quake to use that resolution the next time you start it up.
