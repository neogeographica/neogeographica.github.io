If you want to jump right in and start Quaking with minimum effort, this section is for you.

First you should get a modern Quake engine.  The basic idea is that you will download a new Quake executable.  There may be some other files or folders along with it, but at a minimum you're getting a program that you will run to play Quake.

When you run this program, it will look for an "id1" folder in some location. Usually, at least on Windows systems, it will expect the "id1" folder to be placed right next to the Quake engine program.  (But consult the docs for your Quake engine if you want to be sure.)  So create the "id1" folder if it doesn't yet exist.

Quake requires two files inside the "id1" folder: "pak0.pak" and "pak1.pak". You can get those two pak files from your Steam copy of Quake, or any other Quake installation. Once you have moved or copied those files into your "id1" folder you can start playing.

Below are my recommendations for popular, full-featured, menu-driven modern Quake engines that require a minimum of unintuitive tomfoolery to configure.  There are other fine choices though!  I don't want to start a holy war, just to give folks a quick way to get started.  Please read the Quake Engines guide if you want the complete picture.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If you're going to get into Quake multiplayer, you'll probably want to get familiar with the difference between QuakeWorld and NetQuake, as described in the Quake Engines guide. Although if you intend to play over an internet connection that isn't the best, then QuakeWorld may be your only real option.

For QuakeWorld, the [url=http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/]ezQuake[/url] engine is a good choice.

(Note that the non-Windows versions of ezQuake are not as well maintained as the Windows version.  If you intend to Quake on OS X or Linux, then you will probably need to check the Quake Engines guide to find some other engine that fits your needs.)

If you want to get ezQuake along with a collection of new textures, HUDs, etc. then you can use the [url=http://www.nquake.com/]nQuake[/url] package. See the ezQuake section of the Quake Engines guide for more details.

When you're using ezQuake you can set up just about everything through the menus.  It's probably worth taking a look at the "Display" sections later in this guide if you want to get everything just right though.

On the other hand if you are checking out NetQuake multiplayer instead of QuakeWorld, then give [url=http://quakeone.com/proquake/]ProQuake[/url] a go. If you're playing on Windows, you may want to use the [url=http://quakeone.com/proquake/ProQuake4_Steam_Upgrade.exe]ProQuake installer for Steam Quake owners[/url].

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
For the best combination of authenticity and compatibility with various content, the singleplayer engine of choice should be [url=http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/]QuakeSpasm[/url]. Get into its options menu, enable mouselook, and away you go. If you're playing on Windows, you may want to use the [url=http://quakeone.com/proquake/Quakespasm_Steam_Easy_Install.exe]QuakeSpasm installer for Steam Quake owners[/url].

The [url=http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/]DarkPlaces[/url] engine is also popular, particularly if you want to change Quake's look 'n feel. DarkPlaces has good in-game menus, but I'd recommend at least taking a look at the "Display" sections below in order to finish up your configuration. Also check the DarkPlaces section of the Quake Engines guide for more info about some installers and bundles you might be interested in.

[h1]Go forth and Quake[/h1]
That's it, quickstart done!  If you have problems you might want to first check in at the Troubleshooting guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=287224659

You can treat the rest of this guide as a reference for when you want to learn more.  It will be especially useful for some of the other Quake engines, and double-especially if you are trying to get the original Quake engines to behave.
