[h1]Display configuration[/h1]
For many of the Quake engines from GLQuake onward, setting your desired video resolution has been a bit of a puzzle. The following sections cover a few different approaches, since there's not a one-size-fits-all solution.

If you've taken a time machine back to the 90s so that you can play on a tiny screen using a 4:3 aspect ratio, then after you set your video resolution you don't have any other major display issues to worry about. If not, though, then you'll have a few other things to consider.

For one thing, when using a modern-sized monitor the statusbar display on the screen can be unnecessarily large. You may want to shrink it down.

And if you're using a widescreen resolution, you will want to have a properly-shaped statusbar (not "stretched") and a wider in-game field of view. Some engines will automatically take care of one or both of these issues for you, but in other cases you'll have to manually configure the display.

[h1]HUD size and shape[/h1]
It's not surprising that you might want to change the size of the HUD. It's a little more unusual to have to worry about its [i]shape[/i], but in some Quake engines that's necessary too. If you're using a widescreen resolution then your statusbar, weapon display, and even the console text can get stretched out horizontally unless you take steps to fix them.

The two pictures below illustrate the problem using GLQuake 0.98 with a widescreen resolution. This resolution has a 16x9 aspect ratio, instead of the 4:3 aspect ratio common in older Quake-era monitors. The top picture shows the view with a widescreen resolution but no other changes/fixes; you can see that the statusbar and weapon are stretched. If the console was open, you'd see that its text was stretched too. The bottom image shows the view after this stretchiness has been fixed through some additional configuration.

In the Quake engines that have this issue, it turns out that the shapes of all these HUD elements, as well as the overall size of the statusbar and the console text, are controlled by settings for the width and height of the console. Different engines specify console dimensions through different methods (which the sections below will describe), but the overall concept is the same:
[list]
[*]Larger console dimensions correspond to smaller statusbar and console text.
[*]Changing the ratio between console width and height will change the shape of the HUD elements.
[/list]
To get the right shape for HUD elements, you want the console width/height to have the same ratio as your screen resolution's width/height. Personally I like to keep the console height as close to 480 as possible to match the original WinQuake design, where the console dimensions were 640x480. So for 16:10 resolutions I use 768x480 for the console dimensions; for 16:9 I use 864x486.

You may also want to adjust your viewsize. Viewsize can be increased/decreased by different methods which can include: a "viewsize" console variable, a menu option, or the "+" and "-" keys. Decreasing the viewsize will just shrink the area of the screen that shows the gameworld, and this isn't too useful on modern systems. Increasing the viewsize can have interesting effects if you continue to increase it even after the screen is filled; increases past this point will typically start removing HUD elements. (A corollary: if you seem to be missing HUD elements, trying shrinking the viewsize.)

[h1]Field of view[/h1]
The original field of view (FOV) for Quake is 90 degrees horizontally. If you are used to this for a 4:3 resolution, then when you switch to a widescreen resolution it can seem cramped and even make you motionsick.

A larger FOV can also just give you an advantage from seeing more, although if you increase it too much you get fisheye effects that can be disorienting and make it harder to aim. In the end the right setting is a matter of personal taste.

I use an FOV of 100 horizontal degrees for 16:10 resolutions, or 106 for 16:9, since these horizontal FOV settings result in approximately the same vertical FOV that I was used to on a 4:3 display. For example, the top image here uses a 90 degree FOV on a 4:3 display (like original Quake); the bottom image uses 106 FOV on a 16:9 display. Notice how in both images you can see the same amount of your surroundings vertically, and the 16:9 display shows more stuff to the left and right.

Some Quake engines will automatically adapt your FOV as you change resolutions. These engines support an "fov" console variable that specifies the desired horizontal FOV for a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the correct FOV for the aspect ratio of your current video resolution will be calculated based on that info.

For other Quake engines you will need to manually set your desired FOV. In these engines the "fov" console variable directly specifies the horizontal FOV, regardless of your video resolution.
