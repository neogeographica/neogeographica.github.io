[h1]Quake (WinQuake) and QuakeWorld[/h1]
In these two original Quake engines, you cannot change the shape or size of HUD elements.

[h1]GLQuake and GLQuakeWorld[/h1]
GLQuake and GLQuakeWorld have the HUD shape behavior described in the "Display" section above. So if you want to change the size of the statusbar and console text, or if you are using a widescreen resolution and need to fix the shape of the HUD elements, you'll need to specify the console width and height.

For GLQuake (version 0.97 or 0.98) and GLQuakeWorld, console width and height are specified using the command-line options "-conwidth" and "-conheight". ([b]Not[/b] console variables.)  So these would be good GLQuake/GLQuakeWorld command-line options for a 16:9 resolution:
[code]-conwidth 864 -conheight 486[/code]
or for a 16:10 resolution:
[code]-conwidth 768 -conheight 480[/code]
Note:

[*]The original GLQuake engine does not support "-conwidth" and "-conheight" unless you have downloaded GLQuake version 0.97 or 0.98. See the "GLQuake Version Issues" section.

[h1]ezQuake, FTEQW, Fodquake, DarkPlaces, and Qrack[/h1]
These engines support setting console dimensions using the "vid_conwidth" and "vid_conheight" console variables, which will save to the config file. So for a 16:9 resolution you could use
[code]
vid_conwidth 864
vid_conheight 486
[/code]
or for 16:10 you could use
[code]
vid_conwidth 768
vid_conheight 480
[/code]
Notes:
[list]
[*]You may need to set these values [i]after[/i] choosing a screen resolution using the in-game menu, in case that action resets them.
[*]The ezQuake engine has a menu option "Wide Aspect". When enabled, this option will decrease the console height so that the console aspect ratio is 16:10. When disabled, it will increase the console height. If you are not using a 16:10 display, or you want more direct control over the size/shape of HUD elements, you should leave the "Wide Aspect" option disabled and just set the "vid_conwidth"/"vid_conheight" values yourself.
[*]FTEQW and Qrack will automatically pick "vid_conwidth"/"vid_conheight" values of the correct aspect ratio when setting a video resolution. (They also expose these values in the video options menu.) If you want to change the size of the statusbar and console text then you can manually set the "vid_conwidth"/"vid_conheight" values.
[*]Fodquake defaults to values of 0 for "vid_conwidth" and "vid_conheight", which in this engine means "pick the correct aspect ratio". As with the other engines, if you want to change the size of the statusbar and console text then you can manually set different values for "vid_conwidth"/"vid_conheight".

[h1]QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, and DirectQ[/h1]
These engines always provide the correct shape for HUD elements and console text.

If you want to change the size of the console text, use the "scr_conscale" console variable.

If you want to change the size of the status bar, use the "scr_sbarscale" console variable. You may also want to try using the video options menu and/or the "scr_sbaralpha" console variable to affect the statusbar transparency. DirectQ has more menu options for statusbar styling.

[h1]Engoo[/h1]
HUD elements and console text will have the correct shape in Engoo.

If you want to change the statusbar size, you will need to disable "automatic scaling" in the view options menu, and then change the "graphics scale" slider. (These menu options correspond to the "scr_retroscale" and "scr_scale" console variables.) These options will also change the scale of on-screen menus, but not of the console text.

[h1]qbism Super8[/h1]
HUD elements and console text will have the correct shape in qbism Super8.

If you want to change the statusbar size, you can change the "status bar scale" slider in the video options menu. (This option corresponds to the "sbar_scale" console variables.) I'm not aware of a way to change the console text size.

[/list]
[h1]ProQuake[/h1]
HUD elements and console text will have the correct shape in ProQuake.

If you want to change the size of those things, change the "console width" setting in the Advanced Settings part of the options menu. (This option corresponds to the "vid_consize" console variable).
