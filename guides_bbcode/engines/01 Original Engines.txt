When you install Quake from Steam, and you try to launch it, you will be given four options: Quake, QuakeWorld, GLQuake, or GLQuakeWorld.  These are the four original Quake "engines" provided by id software.  A Quake engine is just a program that can understand and use Quake game data files -- it's a program you run in order to play Quake.

[previewimg=233476;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;tmyk.jpg][/previewimg] The engine that Steam just calls "Quake" is more usually known as "WinQuake", because it is a version of Quake rewritten to use the Windows operating system rather than DOS.  Just FYI in case you see references to WinQuake elsewhere.

Steam doesn't give you the original DOS Quake engine, but there's not really any reason to use the DOS version these days.

The motivation behind this variety of Quakes is that there are two major divisions in Quake technology: multiplayer protocol (NetQuake vs. QuakeWorld) and graphics rendering (software vs. OpenGL).

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
In Quake multiplayer as it was first released, the client (the player's computer) would tell the server what it wanted to do, the server would tell the client what happened as a result, and the client would then show those results.  This is a straightforward arrangement, but it becomes frustrating when there is a long network delay between client and server.  This delay made people observe that movement in the original Quake could feel like "ice skating".

QuakeWorld was a dramatic revision of Quake that incorporated client-side prediction.  The client was allowed to immediately show the results of player action; if it happened to be mistaken, the server could correct it later, causing the client to "jump" to comply with the correct state of the world.  Client-side prediction makes QuakeWorld multiplayer feel more responsive, but the occasional correction from the server can make it seem more erratic or flaky than the original Quake (now sometimes called NetQuake, to differentiate it from QuakeWorld).

Over time many players eventually gravitated to QuakeWorld, but there are still multiplayer communities that prefer NetQuake.

[h1]Rendering[/h1]
Quake was originally released with a software renderer.  An OpenGL renderer was added in a later release, providing hardware-accelerated graphics with texture filtering and other effects.

The OpenGL versions of NetQuake and QuakeWorld were very popular, to the point of single-handedly boosting the adoption of addon video cards like the 3dfx Voodoo.  However they did change Quake's look: textures smoothed, lighting changed in certain ways, water and sky effects different, and rendered pixel colors (after applying texture filtering and lighting) no longer restricted to be exactly on the Quake palette.  Not everyone was a fan of these changes, so the use of the software renderer didn't die out.

[h1]Pick and Mix[/h1]
The four original Quake engines cover all the combinations of those variations:
[list]
[*]Quake: NetQuake multiplayer, software renderer
[*]GLQuake: NetQuake multiplayer, OpenGL renderer
[*]QuakeWorld: QuakeWorld multiplayer, software renderer
[*]GLQuakeWorld: QuakeWorld multiplayer, OpenGL renderer
[/list]
Which one you choose depends on what style of multiplayer (if any) and graphics rendering you prefer.  The content you wish to play can also drive your choice; for example, most singleplayer maps and mods are developed with NetQuake engines in mind rather than QuakeWorld.  In fact, the original QuakeWorld engine cannot even play the out-of-the-box Quake singleplayer campaign; it's multiplayer only.  Multiplayer mods may be made with either NetQuake or QuakeWorld in mind.

So it's handy to have all of these engine choices available.
