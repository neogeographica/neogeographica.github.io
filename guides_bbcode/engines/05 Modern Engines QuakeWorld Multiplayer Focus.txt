[previewimg=234250;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;ezQuake32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/]ezQuake[/url] (Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeBSD) is the most popular client for QuakeWorld multiplayer.  It also has some limited support for singleplayer content (playing the original Quake campaign or other maps that don't require a mod), and can act as a server to host QuakeWorld games.  It comes in software-renderer and OpenGL varieties.

You can learn more about it at the ezQuake site; however to install it I would recommend using the [url=http://nquake.com/]nQuake[/url] package, which includes the ezQuake engine along with popular addons and graphics presets, along with AI bots for playing skirmish deathmatch.

nQuake will install to its own folder on your computer, separate from your Steam files. After installation you should manually copy the pak1.pak file from your Steam copy of Quake into the id1 folder of nQuake.

If you don't like the solid-color player skins that nQuake configures, a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/2310/discussions/0/648817378248383503/]forum thread[/url] has solutions for you.

More info about the AI bots included in nQuake can be found in this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123626484

[previewimg=234252;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;FTEQW32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://www.fteqw.com/]FTEQW[/url] (Windows, Linux) is another QuakeWorld client currently in use; it can also act as a server to host QuakeWorld games.  Along with an OpenGL renderer, its Windows version also supports Direct3D 9; the Direct3D renderer may perform better on Windows systems that have weak OpenGL support.  FTEQW is something of a "swiss army knife" client that also provides support for NetQuake multiplayer (client only), singleplayer, mapfile formats from other games, and even Quake 2/3 multiplayer (client only).

Unlike most of the Quake engines in this list, FTEQW has not had a build blessed as "stable" since 2011 even though it is still undergoing development. If you're interested in using FTEQW, you may want to try out the [url=http://fteqw.com/ftedownloads/30-downloads/75-maintrunk]current experimental build[/url]; the downside of course is that if some major change has happened recently, things might be broken.

[previewimg=235114;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;Fodquake32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://www.fodquake.net/]Fodquake[/url] (Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeBSD) completes the trifecta of currently-popular QuakeWorld clients; it uses an OpenGL renderer.  It's less feature-stuffed than ezQuake or FTEQW, with a focus on technical improvements in areas like rendering and network protocol.  It does not support singleplayer, and also cannot host multiplayer games.
