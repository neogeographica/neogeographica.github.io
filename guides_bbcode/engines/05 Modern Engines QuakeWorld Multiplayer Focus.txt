[previewimg=234250;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;ezQuake32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/]ezQuake[/url] (Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeBSD) is the most popular client for QuakeWorld multiplayer.  It also has some limited support for singleplayer content (playing the original Quake campaign or other maps that don't require a mod), and can act as a server to host QuakeWorld games.  It comes in software-renderer and OpenGL varieties.

You can learn more about it at the ezQuake site; however to install it I would recommend using the [url=http://nquake.com/]nQuake[/url] package, which includes the ezQuake engine along with popular addons and graphics presets, along with AI bots for playing skirmish deathmatch.

nQuake will install to its own folder on your computer, separate from your Steam files. After installation you should manually copy the pak1.pak file from your Steam copy of Quake into the id1 folder of nQuake.

If you don't like the solid-color player skins that nQuake configures, a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/2310/discussions/0/648817378248383503/]forum thread[/url] has solutions for you.

More info about the AI bots included in nQuake can be found in this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123626484

[previewimg=234252;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;FTEQW32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://triptohell.info/moodles/?C=M;O=D]FTE[/url] (Windows, Linux) is another QuakeWorld client currently in use; it can also act as a server to host QuakeWorld games.  Along with an OpenGL renderer, its Windows version also supports Direct3D 9; the Direct3D renderer may perform better on Windows systems that have weak OpenGL support.  FTE is something of a "swiss army knife" that also provides support for NetQuake multiplayer (client only), singleplayer, bsp2 format, many extra features for mappers and mod developers, and even Quake 2/3 multiplayer (client only). It provides a selection of graphics presets ranging from fancy-eye-candy to nearly-WinQuake-faithful.

Unlike most of the Quake engines in this list, FTE does not have a "stable" build available. If you want FTE you'll have to go to its [url=http://triptohell.info/moodles/?C=M;O=D]repository of automated builds[/url]. For Windows, you want to get fteqw64.exe from the win64 folder, or fteqw.exe from the win32 folder. Various Linux builds are also available.

[previewimg=235114;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;Fodquake32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://www.fodquake.net/]Fodquake[/url] (Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeBSD) completes the trifecta of currently-popular QuakeWorld clients; it uses an OpenGL renderer.  It's less feature-stuffed than ezQuake or FTE, with a focus on technical improvements in areas like rendering and network protocol.  It does not support singleplayer, and also cannot host multiplayer games.
