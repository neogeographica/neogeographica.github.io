[previewimg=234255;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;QuakeSpasm32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/]QuakeSpasm[/url] (Windows, OS X, Linux) is a crossplatform descendant of the classic Fitzquake engine; it uses an OpenGL renderer.  It supports NetQuake multiplayer (client or server) but is primarily used for singleplayer content -- many Quake singleplayer map releases these days require (or at least are primarily tested with) an engine from the Fitzquake family.  It supports the bsp2 format. QuakeSpasm is faithful to GLQuake's original look while still providing bugfixes and usability improvements.

Most of the Quake videos from the "Custom Gamer" YouTube channel use QuakeSpasm, e.g.:

A [url=http://quakeone.com/proquake/Quakespasm_Steam_Easy_Install.exe]QuakeSpasm installer for Steam Quake owners[/url] is available for Windows. It will place the QuakeSpasm engine and libraries in your Steam Quake folder; it doesn't replace any of the Steam-provided Quake engines, but it can access the .pak data files in Steam with no need for file copying. An uninstaller is provided that will clean up all of its files without harming your Steam installation.

Note that QuakeSpasm has at least one library in common with the files installed by the "Ultimate Quake Patch". If you use both the "Ultimate Quake Patch" [i]and[/i] the "QuakeSpasm for Steam" installer at the same time, the operation of DarkPlaces and/or QuakeSpasm may be affected. And uninstalling the QuakeSpasm files will remove a library used by DarkPlaces. It's probably best not to use both of those installers at the same time; if you want to use both of those engines, then you will need to manually set up one or both of them in their own folder(s). If you want to continue to share the .pak data files, then the "Engine Coexistence" section below has some relevant tips.

The "QuakeSpasm for Steam" installer can however co-exist happily with the "ProQuake for Steam" installer described below.

[previewimg=234251;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;Fitzquake32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://celephais.net/board/view_thread.php?id=60831]Fitzquake Mark V[/url] (Windows) is another OpenGL-using branch of Fitzquake, therefore similar to QuakeSpasm (see above) in most aspects, including bsp2 support.  It has a particular focus on bugfixing, providing debug tools for content creation, and code cleanup/documentation for the benefit of engine hackers. If you like Fitzquake/QuakeSpasm and you Quake exclusively on Windows, Fitzquake Mark V is a good tool to have in your Quake Engine Toolbox. In some cases it may perform better than other Fitzquake-based engines, or have a key feature or bugfix that you need. It's also nicely portable as a single executable that doesn't rely on external libraries.

[previewimg=234249;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;DirectQ32.png][/previewimg] [url=https://www.quaddicted.com/files/engines/directq/DirectQ%201.9.0%20Executable.zip]DirectQ[/url] (Windows) as the name implies uses Direct3D 9.  As one of the few engines with a primary focus on a written-from-scratch Direct3D renderer, on some systems it may be the Windows engine with the best performance -- although with standard Quake content, performance is only likely to be an issue on a low cost/power system (e.g. a small netbook with integrated graphics hardware).  DirectQ is aimed at providing a cleaned-up renderer, with even more usability improvements than QuakeSpasm/Fitzquake, and it supports NetQuake multiplayer (client or server).

[previewimg=1272075;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;Engoo32.png][/previewimg] [url=http://leileilol.mancubus.net/engoo/]Engoo[/url] (Windows) uses a software renderer (and so does not support the Steam community overlay). Engoo is intended for singleplayer; NetQuake multiplayer support is present but untested. Out of the box it has a faithful WinQuake appearance, but unlike WinQuake it has widescreen support. It also provides many menu-driven options for different rendering modes and effects. Engoo even provides presets for mimicking the appearance of Quake 1.01, Quake 1.07, GLQuake, or Quake64 ... either an amusing feature or maybe an essential one, depending on how deep down the Quake rabbit-hole you've fallen.

[previewimg=1306318;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;qbismS832.png][/previewimg] [url=http://super8.qbism.com/]qbism Super8[/url] (Windows) also uses a software renderer.  It supports NetQuake multiplayer (client or server) but is primarily used for singleplayer content, including bsp2 support. Unlike many of the above engines, Super8 isn't concerned with replicating a "faithful" Quake experience. Along with modern conveniences like widescreen support and good in-game menus, Super8 also alters Quake's visuals to aim for what its author calls a "meta-nostalgic" effect... not Quake as it actually was, but something else low-fi and gritty (maybe "Quake like you remember it"?).

If you would rather try to tune Super8 to look like WinQuake, you can read its docs to get a recommended configuration for that purpose, and also delete or move aside the "pak88.pak" file which contains Super8's custom palettes and models. But Super8's strong point is its unique aesthetic -- you should give its default setup a try. The video below shows clips of Super8 gameplay on the custom map "honey" by czg:
