[h1]Updated Quake[/h1]
With the release of the Quake source code, enterprising developers started work on their own versions of Quake almost immediately.  These new versions of Quake are generally focussed on bug fixing, increasing the limits on the number of things supported in a Quake map, tackling usability problems, supporting the use of other textures/models/sounds, and adding new visual effects.

Also many of these new engines can play music files in OGG and/or MP3 format.  This is especially useful if you only own a digital download of Quake and you don't have the soundtrack as it was originally provided (music tracks on the Quake CD).  If you can obtain the Quake soundtrack in OGG/MP3 format, then using a modern Quake engine you can once again hear it while you play.  More details about soundtrack file support in this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=119489135
There is very little reason to stick with the original Quake engines instead of using a modern engine.  If you intend to play third-party content a modern engine may actually be required.

Each engine mentioned below has a long development history and many features, but I'm going to do my best to describe its intentions and "selling points" very briefly.  There are also many other Quake engines out there, but I want to limit this section to those that are most widely used.  If you're a superfan of a particular engine and notice that I've gotten something wrong, please let me know.

[h1]Which Engines for What[/h1]
As a first pass for engine selection, keep these criteria in mind:
[list]
[*]QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, DirectQ, and DarkPlaces are the most popular engines for playing singleplayer.  The first three are intended to provide a classic GLQuake look (with some renderer bugfixes), while DarkPlaces is more about a modified/updated look.  Engoo is another singleplayer engine that supports a range of looks from WinQuake-faithful to highly modified.  qbism Super8 is an engine dedicated to a specific low-fi look.  All of the engines described in this guide (except Fodquake) have some amount of support for singleplayer.
[/list]
[list]
[*]ezQuake, FTE, and Fodquake are the most popular engines for playing QuakeWorld multiplayer.  DarkPlaces also provides QuakeWorld support.
[/list]
[list]
[*]ProQuake, Qrack, and DarkPlaces are the most popular engines for playing NetQuake multiplayer.  All of the engines described below, except ezQuake and Fodquake, have some amount of support for NetQuake multiplayer.
[/list]
[list]
[*]If you intend to host your own multiplayer games, then preferably you should set up a dedicated server.  However, you can use these engines to do quick-and-dirty hosting (as a "listen server") that could be handy for casual LAN play. ezQuake and FTE can host QuakeWorld games; all of the remaining engines (except Fodquake) can host NetQuake games.
[/list]
[list]
[*]A few recent large and/or complex singleplayer map releases make use of the new "bsp2" map format for Quake. See [url=https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/something_wicked.html]Something Wicked This Way Comes[/url], [url=https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/nyarlathotep.html]Nyarlathotep[/url], and [url=https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/rrp.html]Rubicon Rumble Pack[/url] for example. Maps in bsp2 format aren't common (yet?), but bsp2 support may be something you'll want to have if you are interested in new singleplayer maps. That means using the most recent version of DarkPlaces, QuakeSpasm, Fitzquake Mark V, qbism Super8, or latest automated build of FTE. (See also the Other Modern Engines section below.)

[h1]Getting Started[/h1]
Whichever engine you choose, you're going to end up getting a new Quake executable. There may be some other files or folders along with it, but at a minimum you're getting a program that you will run to play Quake.

When you run this program, it will look for an "id1" folder in some location. Usually, at least on Windows systems, it will expect the "id1" folder to be placed right next to the Quake engine program. (But consult the docs for your Quake engine if you want to be sure.) So create the "id1" folder if it doesn't yet exist.

Quake requires two files inside the "id1" folder: "pak0.pak" and "pak1.pak". You can get those two pak files from your Steam copy of Quake, or any other Quake installation.

So if you own Quake on Steam, you can use any of the engines described below. Some of the engines have related file-bundles or other installers that can make the process easier, and I'll mention some of those, but none of those installers/bundles are required.

[h1]Launching through Steam[/h1]
If you prefer launching Quake through the Steam UI, that works just fine when using a modern Quake engine. You have a couple of options:

Most simply, you can use Steam's "Add a Non-Steam Game" feature to create a shortcut to launch the Quake engine of your choice. Done. Enjoy having Quake in your common game launcher, and use the Steam community overlay if the engine supports it.

However you may want to launch the modern Quake engine of your choice when you click Play for Steam's normal "Quake" entry in your game library. This approach is helpful if you want to upload screenshots to Steam's Quake "community hub", make use of the Steam Cloud for your config and savegames, or track how many hours you've spent in the game. And it's also easy to set this up, because when Steam launches a Quake engine all it does is find an executable with a particular name and run it. You can replace those files and Steam won't care (unless Quake gets an update someday, which is... unlikely).

If you choose "Play Game..." from Quake's context menu in Steam, or you choose "Play Quake" from the Play menu, then Steam will run whatever program is in the Steam Quake folder ("steamapps\common\quake") that is named Winquake.exe. If you choose "Launch QuakeWorld", Steam will run qwcl.exe. "Launch GLQuake" will run GLquake.exe. "Launch GLQuakeWorld" will run glqwcl.exe.

So, steps for making Steam launch the engine of your choice when playing Quake:
[list]
[*]Download and install Quake as usual through Steam.
[*]Gather up the executable, libraries, and any other files for your engine of choice; move or copy them into Steam's Quake folder.
[*]Decide which of Steam's Quake engines you want to replace. Delete its executable, or move it somewhere else for safekeeping.
[*]Rename the executable of your modern Quake engine, to replace the file you removed.
[/list]
Finally: you may need to disable the Steam community overlay. Don't do that right away, but if launching Quake through Steam fails, then the first thing you should try as a fix is to open Steam's properties dialog for Quake and disable the overlay.
