There are multiple approaches to using Quake soundtrack files. What's the right one for you?  It depends on which Quake engine you are using. If that sentence confuses you, then have a look at this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118401000

[h1]Engines that don't have soundtrack support[/h1]
The ProQuake engine as of version 4.91beta no longer supports any kind of soundtrack playback, not even CD audio.

Engoo does not officially support CD audio (although it might work for you). It can play MIDI files but that doesn't help with playing the soundtrack.

[h1]Engines that only support CD audio[/h1]
The original Quake engines (the ones provided by Steam) only support CD audio. If you want to get them to play music files, you will have to modify them. I haven't tried this myself, but Dragonsbrethren has posted a guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113399618
Most modern Quake engines also still support CD audio, so there is a good chance that this modification would also work on them. But if an engine can manage one of the other solutions below, it would probably be better to use that other solution.

[h1]Engines that play soundtrack music files[/h1]
Some Quake engines can play music files to give you a soundtrack during the game. Among the choices listed in the "Quake Engines" guide, soundtrack file playback is supported by [url=http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/]DarkPlaces[/url], [url=http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/]QuakeSpasm[/url], [url=http://celephais.net/board/view_thread.php?id=60831]FitzQuake Mark V[/url], [url=https://www.quaddicted.com/files/engines/directq/DirectQ%201.9.0%20Executable.zip]DirectQ[/url], [url=http://super8.qbism.com/]qbism Super8[/url], [url=https://www.quaddicted.com/engines/requiem]reQuiem[/url], and [url=http://www.quakeforge.net/]QuakeForge[/url].

For soundtrack file playback to work, a few things have to be considered:
[list]
[*]whether the music files are "loose files", or inside pak/pk3 archives
[*]where the files are placed
[*]what the files are named
[*]what audio format the files are in
[/list]

Different Quake engines support different answers for those questions. However the first three questions have a common set of answers that will work for all engines mentioned above.

If you already have a setup that works for the engine you're currently using, I'm not saying you should change it. This is just a description of a common arrangement that works for multiple engines:
[list]
[*]The music files are loose files, [b]NOT[/b] inside a pak or pk3 archive.
[/list]
[list]
[*]The files are placed inside a "music" subfolder of the "id1" folder. For missionpack or mod soundtracks, the files are placed in a "music" subfolder of the appropriate game folder. So the original Quake soundtrack files go inside "id1\music", Mission Pack 1 soundtrack files go inside "hipnotic\music", and Mission Pack 2 soundtrack files go inside "rogue\music".
[/list]
[list]
[*]The files are named in the pattern "track[i]nn[/i]", where "[i]nn[/i]" is the CD track number that the file was ripped from. Since the soundtrack starts at the second CD track, MP3 soundtrack files are named "track02.mp3", "track03.mp3", etc. OGG soundtrack files are named "track02.ogg", "track03.ogg", etc.
[/list]
As for the audio format: most of the distributions of the Quake soundtrack are in OGG format, and OGG files can be played by most of these Quake engines. If you have both OGG and MP3 files then you are covered for sure. Specifically, the Quake engines discussed here support the following formats:
[list]
[*]DarkPlaces: OGG, WAV
[*]QuakeSpasm: OGG, MP3, WAV
[*]FitzQuake Mark V: MP3
[*]DirectQ: OGG, MP3, WMA, WAV
[*]qbism Super8: OGG, MP3
[*]reQuiem: MP3
[*]QuakeForge: OGG
[/list]
Some quirks to be aware of:
[list]
[*]For OGG support in DirectQ, you must install the [url=http://xiph.org/dshow/]DirectShow filter for OGG[/url].
[*]The Linux version of QuakeSpasm requires external libraries: libogg or libvorbis for OGG support, and libmad or libmpg123 for MP3. I'm not sure if DarkPlaces' OGG support on Linux has the same requirement, but I suspect it does.
[*]QuakeForge needs a "tracklist.cfg" file that tells it where to find the music tracks. If you downloaded a soundtrack package linked at the top of this guide, then you'll get a tracklist.cfg and instructions on where to put it. Otherwise, see the QuakeForge documentation.

[quote][previewimg=233460;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;tmyk.jpg][/previewimg] Quake soundtrack files that you get from somewhere else may end up in the "sound\cdtracks" subfolder instead of the "music" subfolder. This is a location that DarkPlaces will look for soundtrack files, but most other Quake engines will not look there. You can move the files to the "music" subfolder to make them accessible to all Quake engines (including DarkPlaces).

Soundtrack files are also sometimes distributed inside a pk3 file. This works with some engines, but not with others. A pk3 file is just a zip archive, so if you want, you can open it up with any unzip utility, extract the tracks, and put the extracted tracks in the appropriate "music" subfolder.

[h1]Engines that control external players[/h1]
If a Quake engine has a feature that allows it to control an external player application, it may be possible to play the soundtrack that way. The tricky part is to get the right music to automatically play at the right times.

For the [url=http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/]ezQuake[/url] engine, Pirate-X posted a [url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=27018156&postcount=32]scripting solution for controlling Winamp[/url] on the old Steam forums.

[url=http://fodquake.net/]Fodquake[/url] and [url=http://www.fteqw.com/]FTEQW[/url] include support for controlling an external Winamp process, but I'm not aware of how to script them for soundtrack play.
