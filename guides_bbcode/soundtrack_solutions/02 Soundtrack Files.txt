For any of the solutions in this guide, you first have to get a set of music files that make up the Quake soundtrack: one file for every music track on the original CD. There are various places you can get these, but I recommend this set that I generated:

[/list]
(Obviously, you only need the mission pack soundtracks if you have the mission packs.)

If you are using one of the modern "Quake engines" (programs for playing Quake) mentioned in this guide below as supporting soundtrack files, then all you need to do is follow the easy instructions included in each of the above download archives. Basically you'll just need to move a "music" folder to the correct location within your Quake installation.

If on the other hand you're determined to use the original Quake programs, there are solutions described below for them as well, but it won't be quite so easy.

You can find Quake soundtrack files at other spots around the web too. The reasons that I decided to make yet another package of soundtrack files are: other soundtrack files probably have not removed the CD pre-emphasis (none that I've tested have done this), and they may not work with your Quake engine of choice unless you rename, relocate, and/or reformat the files. Using the packages linked above will avoid all of those problems.

[quote][previewimg=233460;sizeOriginal,floatLeft;tmyk.jpg][/previewimg] The music on the Quake CD has "pre-emphasis". OK... what does that mean?

The hydrogenaudio wiki has a [url=http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Pre-emphasis]summary of pre-emphasis[/url] that is worth a look if you want details. The upshot though is this: to make the playback sound correct, ripped files need to be processed with a specific equalization curve to get rid of the pre-emphasis. This matches what your CD player did when playing the physical CD.

Ripping a CD with iTunes will handle such "de-emphasis" automatically. The hydrogenaudio wiki page has some tips about other ripping methods, and Google will also turn up good discussion about this.

The difference between Quake tracks that have been properly de-emphasized and those that haven't is fairly subtle to hear. But a spectral analysis (showing the volume at different frequencies) can make what's going on a little clearer. Here's an example comparing the first Quake track not de-emphasized (top) vs. correctly de-emphasized (bottom):
[previewimg=237579;sizeThumb,inline;track02-ogg.png][/previewimg]
[previewimg=237578;sizeThumb,inline;track02-deemph-ogg.png][/previewimg]

Without de-emphasis, the higher frequencies will be too loud.

If you are using soundtrack files that you downloaded from somewhere else, and you don't know whether or not they have been correctly de-emphasized... well, they probably haven't been, but you might not want to lose sleep over it. Just something to keep in mind. If you want to test it, you can get the free [url=http://spek.cc/]Spek[/url] tool, use it to open up your track02.ogg or track02.mp3 file, and compare the image you get to the images above.[/quote]

If you would rather rip the tracks yourself, you'll need to start with a physical Quake CD or CD image. ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/2310/discussions/0/882966056497559791/]A thread on the Steam forums[/url] provides download links for soundtrack CD images.) You can use virtual CD software like [url=http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html]Virtual Clone Drive[/url] to "mount" the CD image so that applications see it as a real CD. Once you've ripped the CD, you'll need to make sure that the ripped tracks are encoded to the right format, named correctly, and put in the correct location. This guide won't go into any details about the ripping process, but the sections below describe the necessary file format/naming/placing.

Note that Quake will play CD audio from a mounted CD image just like it would from the real Quake CD, so that's one way to hear the soundtrack. But it's a bit of a hassle to mount an image whenever you want to play, and that approach suffers from the same tracks-not-looping problem as real CDs. So let's not do that!
