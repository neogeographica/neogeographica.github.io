Most botmatches are probably FFA or perhaps 1-on-1.  But if you want to play a team mode, then you need to put yourself on one of the available teams.  So:

In Quake, teams have colors.

In the original NetQuake multiplayer code, players were separated onto teams based on their pants color.  QuakeWorld still separated teams by color but added the concept of a team name; generally picking your team name was the important thing, and your color followed from that.

Each bot mod provides a slightly different way of joining a team.

Use the "menu" command to bring up the interactive menu.

If a game is currently running, choose the "stop game" option.

Select the "teamplay" option in the menu until it shows the number of teams you wish to have.  (For example, if you want to have 2 teams then select that option twice.)

Now you need to use a console command to join a team.  The available commands are "team1", "team2", etc. up through the number of teams.

In FBX++, if "teamplay" is set to a value of 1 then you are already on a team.  Your team's color is determined by your current pants color.  When you first add bots to the opposing team, FBX++ will just choose some other color for that team.

If you use the provided teamplay game mode scripts, then you will either be automatically be placed on a team or (for Clan Arena) be asked what team you wish to join.

If you are experimenting with your own combinations of settings for teamplay, various things can happen; the bottom line though should be that if the game code doesn't force you to a particular team, then the value of your "team" console variable will provide your team name.
