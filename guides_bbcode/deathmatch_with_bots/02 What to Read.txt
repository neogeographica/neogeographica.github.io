This guide is fairly comprehensive... basically a reference.  If you're a complete newbie or just impatient, you probably want to hit the "Quick Start" section and play around with that stuff for a while.  Finish the rest of the guide when you want to figure out what is really going on and how to reconfigure your games.

If you're already familiar with Quake and mods, and you want to get your hands dirty: you can jump right to the "Mod Files" and "Extra Map Support" sections.  Come back and check the other sections later, or if you run across some confusing behavior.

If you already know what file you want and you're just coming back to this guide to get a download link, head for the "Link Recap" section at the end.
